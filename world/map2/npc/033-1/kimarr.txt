// Fluffy hunting quest
// initially by Jenalya
// more by alastrim
// broken by o11c, then fixed

// Variables:
// global $@Fluffy_Hunting - state of the quest
//      0: nobody is hunting
//    1-2: 2 timer iterations to give time for the warp to finish.
//      3: somebody is hunting. The script checks every second if there is food on the ground.
// global $@Fluffy_Time - the number of seconds since you entered the area
// global $@Fluffy_Spawn - how many fluffies have been spawned
// global $@Fluffy_Kills - how many fluffies you have killed so far
// global $@Fluffy_Min - how many fluffies you have to kill to get a reward
// global $@Fluffy_Alive - how many fluffies are currently alive
// global $@Fluffy_PC_Deaths - used to keep track of whether the fluffies kill you
// global $@Fluffy_Fighter$ - name of the person hunting fluffies (only used for ornamentation)
// global $@Fluffy_FighterID - ID of the person hunting fluffies
// nibble 0 of QUEST_Barbarians - state for this and adjacent NPCs
//      0: haven't talked about it
//      1: heard about it
//      2: finished quest
//      3: got reward

// Note: if you're going to reenable the "drop multiple times" feature
// 1: please do it every second, not just once you've killed everything - Done
// 2: you should change $@Fluffy_Spawn to $@Fluffy_Alive and decrement it on kills
//  Kept $@Fluffy_Spawn and added $@Fluffy_Alive. The script spawns the amount related to what you drop at each specific time.
// 3: add a variable to spawn more fluffies if you drop more than 100 apples, as you kill them

// Also, the $@Fluffy_Extra behaviour should be reconsidered (hardly anything spawns ...)
// that's the only reason I didn't make that one a local variable like it really is
