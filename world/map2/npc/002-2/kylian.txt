// state 1: player has the task to get the luggage from the harbor
// state 2: Adrian gave the luggage to the player
// state 3: player gave luggage to Kylian and Kylian asks who to talk to for the shop license

// state 6: Kylian asks where to go to have some fun in the evening (casino)
// state 7: Kylian asks where to get exquisite clothing before going out in the evening
// after the player answered this, @KylianNTSightSeeing is set.

// state 8: Kylian was in the casino and gives a desert hat as reward
// state 9: Shop approved, go talk Kylian's shopkeeper if you are looking for work.
// state 10: Meet Shop keeper
// state 11: Start Time Trial
