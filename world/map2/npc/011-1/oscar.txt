// Annual_Quest variable:
//  This variable contains 4 bytes that are used to check if a player
//  completed or not an annual quest. The first byte will be used by this
//  after-Halloween event.
//  Each byte contains the value "year minus 2000" where year is the next year
//  when the player can start over the annual quest.
//  Be sure to not have a quest whose duration overlaps on two years,
//  or this will cause problems.

// The second byte contains easter information, see annualeaster.txt for more information.

// Halloween quest states:
//  0: nothing started
//  1: the player knows the story and is asked to go find pumpkin seeds in the forest
//  2: the player gathered enough seeds
//  3: the player gave the pumpkin seeds and can now help the farmer to grow them
//  the player can chose that the pumpkins patches will be watered by kaflosh (requires Nature Magic lvl 2), -> jumps to 5
//  4: the player is asked to go refill water bottles
//  5: various possible states here: the water bottles are refilled and the pumpkin spawns will start right away.
//                                   the player will start by kafloshing ($@HalloweenQuest_PumpkinHunter$ == "")
//  5 + $@HalloweenQuest_PumpkinHunter$ != "":* the player watered the patches (by kaflosh, or the farmer did). Pumpkins spawn.
//  6: the player saved the farmer from the pumpkin invasion (all pumpkins / mobs killed)
//  10: the player failed to save the farmer from the pumpkin invasion (player left the map, died -- logging off is allowed however)
