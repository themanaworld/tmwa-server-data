{title:Wushin overhauled caves, Ferry now goes to Nivalis}
{date:2013-06-29}

This release brings a few new additions to the game:

Wushin overhauled the desert caves with an awesome
new cave tileset. Also the sewers below Tulimshar are
now accessible. Make sure to check them out!

Malivox took the occasion to stop camping in the
desert and moved into a small house south of
Tulimshar.

Frozenbeard has expanded his ferry service in
Nivalis. You can now go between Nivalis and
the other major docks both ways. Proper docks for
Nivalis are being worked on.

With a ferry now serving Nivalis, Dyrin will send you
somehwere else in Kaizei instead, away from Nivalis.

As usual there are also a lot of smaller fixes and
changes. Thanks to everyone who reported issues
and helped fix these things!
