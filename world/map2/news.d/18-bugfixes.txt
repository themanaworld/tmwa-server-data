{title:Small Bugfixes}
{date:2013-04-28}

We're having a bugfix release today.

The main areas that have been fixed are Brodomir's PvP Cave
and Orum's quest, both in the
caves below Hurnscald.

Additionally, there were a lot of small fixes
on maps, spelling and grammar, and more.

We'd like to thank all the people who reported issues and helped
testing!
