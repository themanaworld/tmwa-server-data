Heya Manakins. Valia should be back in action
and ready for you to save the day again.
Be warned she has less patience for fools now.

The Ferry now uses a set of emblems to denote
where it current is docked along with an audio
cue.

{ul}
{li}Valia camper "fixed" & Illia quest
works again.{/li}
{li}Ferry uses a Visual and Audio Cue
instead of annoucements.{/li}
{li}More beds were made "sleepable"{/li}
{li}Travelers refer to proper continenets{/li}
{li}Towels are Worthless{/li}
{/ul}
