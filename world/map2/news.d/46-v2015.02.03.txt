{title:New art in Kaizei and skills description}
{date:2015-02-03}

Starting with an errata: new tilesets for
Kaizei continent were announced for the last
update but actually they are the feature for
this one. Lots of typos in Xmas Inn were
corrected, and there are totally new descriptions
for skills that are featured on Skills window.
Parua has now some explanations about why Candor
battle exists, for the most curious ones.
