{title:Server Crash and Rollback}
{date:2013-06-05}

We had a server crash, and had to restore everything from offline backup.

34 hours were lost, from about 17:30 (UTC) on 4 June to about 03:30 on 6 June. This affects the game, the forums, and the wiki.

We're going to set up hourly offsite backups of game, forum, and wiki data so that future outages are less painful.
