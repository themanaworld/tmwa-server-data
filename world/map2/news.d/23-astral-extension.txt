{title:Astral Magic Extension}
{date:2013-09-14}

We have a small content release today.
A witch in Tulimshar has found some daunting spells
for mages who are experienced in Astral Magic.
Talk to her about that. Maybe she is willing to teach you.

With this update, we have added some minor bugfixes for the
Waric script, Bluepar sprite and Wicked Mushroom sprite.
