{title:New tutorial, road between Hurnscald and Nivalis and more}
{date:2015-01-13}

The hugest change in this patch is the one in 
the tutorial, it's faster and more intuitive, 
making new players more comfortable and able
to explore The Mana World faster. Also, now  
you can reach Nivalis by going through the 
Woodlands which makes a funny new way to travel.
