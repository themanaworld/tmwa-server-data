// Master config file for The Mana World Athena (map component)
// This file is used since version 14.x.y

// Do NOT change the order of the slave includes
// Older server versions hard-coded the loaders in (mostly) this order,
// and there may still be code dependencies.

// The plan is to turn some of these into just plain 'import' eventually?
