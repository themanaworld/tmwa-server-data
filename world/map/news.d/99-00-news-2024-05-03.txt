{b}TMW turned 20:{/b}
    The Mana World achieved mindblasting feat!
We've been up and running whole 20 years! Thanks
everyone involved! Its really amazing miracle.

Event had 3 parts.
    Leprechauns made appearance, led by Rick Lime.
Tricky and mischievous, fun and chaos ensued. So
some players look like Leprechauns or got strange
"rainerang" weapons now.

    Next day pirates landed Tulimshar shores. But
it wasn't as simple. They were coming from past
where their fleet is intact and famous pirate,
Blanc, leads numerous team to battle. Players put
corrections to Blanc's plan, scuttling ships and
dispatching team!

    Along the lines ancient evil returned.
Reaper crossed from world of dead! It attempted to
collect souls and bodies for undead armies, taking
on leprechauns, pirates and players. Reaper managed
to acquire scary powers! But players were not
scared. Enraged, Reaper sent them to Abyss! But it's
been bad plan. Burned by rough travel and beaten,
Reaper had to hide in shadows to recover.

The Mana World became safe again. For now.

{b}Server shakeups:{/b}
    Unfortunately it wasn't as simple as that.
We faced server-related fallouts, but despite life
giving us pressure, we survived and put 20 years
event going anyway. So nothing we can't handle.
    We had to reduce server VM specs to stay within
budget. But its still more than enough to keep game
server fast. Thanks to Freeyorp for wrangling this.
    We had to move wiki into external resource, its
now hosted on another host by miraheze.org. Data
migration been done by thorbjorn.
    We would like to thank jak1 for providing us
powerful and nice hosting for CI builds, and we
thank ko2fan for providing even faster replacement.

If you notice any issues, contact staff.

{b}Monsters:{/b}
    Since last news record TMW got sizable number
of new monsters originating from Evol or ML worlds.
Some already put into various locations. Some are
not yet in wide use - but present on server.
    Now there're bifs to gather ores and related
items - and even more bifs/slimes to come. Frogs
and tortugas dwell near water, some crocs, and
many other things. Ever fought Moubotaur? Or
maybe took GM Tree for scenery? (Apr 1 joke)
    Some new monsters were created specially for
thematic eventing and hopefully would prove to be
fun in future. Ever fought rough Emo or met
treacherous Rick Lime? Mont Blanc (ship) also
happens to be monster. Undead themed Rotter and
rot got added.

Ball(-15), The Lost(-10), Witch Guard(-20),

    Crypt got extended by some additional areas.
On related note graveyard seen return of JackO,

Stay tuned, because it all would eventually
become available.

{b}Spells:{/b}
    To empower bosses and facilitate gameplay
in between of Kill GM and Dungeon Master some
special set of spells for boss actions been
created. In future it would hopefully allow
more interesting GM/Eventer based events.
    Asorm lasts longer. Changes to betsanc and
conc pots interactions (see Server).
    Dark shroom spawns are better but more costly

{b}Mana client:{/b}
    Mana client became active again! It got
support of current server protocol wired up,
at least to point it can connect current TMWA
server. It could need some polishing but its
exciting to see it back in business!

{b}Server{/b}:
    Spell cooldowns added. Guardian/tyrant,
frillyar and kaflosh status symbols added.
    Max drops raised to 10.
    Crit def added. 
    Vuln/exploit (mass disconnect) fixed.
    WIP: fix for scripts crashing map server.
    Con pots no longer work for magic, but
betsanc no longer hurts delay.

{b}Respawns change:{/b}
    If you'll die in some locations like Graveyard
or Crypt you'll be respawned at your last save
point (usually Soul Menhir). While it could be
eventually annoying, it adds some thrill, making
deaths not free lunch anymore.

{b}New commands:{/b}
    @mobinfo to show some info on monsters.
    @dailypoints to see daily points.
    @mobpoints to see monster points.
    Also @bp, @dp, and @mp aliases.

    Some maps seen fixes. Several new attacks.
E.g. Floyd now got its own attack (book of Floyd
given to players reaching Lv 135). Texts corrections
and minor edits. Added more minimaps. Mods support
added.
