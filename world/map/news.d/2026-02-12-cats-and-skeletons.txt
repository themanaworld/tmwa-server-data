{title:Cats and Skeletons aka Cat-astrophe!}
{date:2025-02-12}

Hello=) and have a nice day, evening, morning or what time it is. This update
made a bit earlier than expected but there was good reason. Fri 13 coming
and so are black cats!

Perhaps black cats are not so unlucky as you think of them? If many players
have bad luck, wouldn't someone also get good luck by chance? Of course cats
are never easy to deal with. Another peculiar cat hides in its cave. Many of
you meet this one already. But it had some love from devs too.

Another rumor claims some strange dark shadow spotted in Crypt Level 2. Who
or what it could possibly be? Dare to try to figure it out?!
