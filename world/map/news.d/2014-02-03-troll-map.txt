{title:Old Tree, New Grind}
{date:2014-02-03}

Today's update includes bug fixes for the
Christmas Event (thanks to Chay).
Also the famous Hurnscald tree is back to its usual form.

Southeast of Tulimshar, in the caves, you will find the
new map 043-4 which was designed to give you a
better possibility to train your character at the levels
around 60-80. Besides well-known monsters you
will find three new mobs there: Trolls, Undead
Trolls and Undead Witches. Thanks to Fother for
the great Troll graphics!

Have fun with this update!
