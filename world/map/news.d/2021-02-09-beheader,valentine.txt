{b}Beheader Quest{/b}

A strange man, with an even stranger weapon, has been spotted wandering The Mana
World as of late.

We advise caution, so you do not end up losing your head by accident! (got the pun?)

{b}Valentine Day 2021{/b}

By popular demand of people trying to take advantage of the new beheader and trying
to behead myself, The Mana World will have a Valentine Day 2021 event.

Quest opens on the saturday 13th 00:00 and closes on the monday 15th 23:59.
Look for the cutest NPC in Hurnscald to do the quest.

The Mana World Team hopes you all have a great Valentine Day.
