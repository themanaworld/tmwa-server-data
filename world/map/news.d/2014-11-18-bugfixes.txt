{title:Candont is Cando again}
{date:2014-11-18}

Today we have a couple minor bug fixes to quests.
TMWA is the big release here with the script ASN/AST.
The script language for TMW has been sanitized.
If you were developing, we should have updates to
the wiki pages soon enough. Otherwise, you can 
always find us on IRC.
