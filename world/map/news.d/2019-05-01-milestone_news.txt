Hello Everyone!

I'm making this announcement to tell you that our first
development milestone for the new server's first release, 
titled The Mana World: rEvolt, is now 100% completed. 
The initial deadline was set at 31/05/19 but we managed to 
finish one month ahead of schedule!

The milestone was called Artis Sewer and included all content 
relating to the underground maps under the city of Artis 
as well as some other bits of content that we wanted 
to be out at the same time. The next milestone, Artis Legion, 
currently sits at 75% completion with a deadline of 30/06/19, 
but given how quickly things have been moving I would say 
we're well ahead of schedule for this one as well!

The third and final milestone, Hurnscald, 
encompasses the biggest part of the release: 
the town of Hurnscald and the surrounding woodland 
region of Argaes. Its deadline represents an 
approximate deadline for the entire release 
and is currently set at 06/09/19.

I want to say thank you to the people who have worked 
the most and the hardest in recent weeks to get us this far. 
Check out my forum post for my rant about that 
and some links to current development!
