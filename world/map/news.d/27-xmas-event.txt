Happy Holidays!

This year has been horrible for Santa. 
Nothing turned out as it was intended, in fact he didn't 
even make it at the usual date.

Gladly, Avalia, Santa's utterly attractive apprentice stepped in
to make Christmas happen for all of the children and lonely
people around the mana world. Go to his workshop and see if 
you can help to make the magic of christmas happen, 

... or make it a complete disaster, 
Orum has some helpers hidden in Nivalis who will guide your
way sabotaging christmas.

This release is very late, so we are going to change reward 
and event time accordingly.

The good thing is that you will now be able to visit 
Santa's Inn throughout the year. 
Cassy breathed life into all those reinboos of last 
years Holidays.
Fothers Candied Slimes are going to cause the sweetest nightmares
you have ever had. Not sure if you are cruel enough to kill
a Pollett.
