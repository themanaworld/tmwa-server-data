{b}Brawler Class: Assassin Set Released{/b}

After a huge attempt of assassination at Luvia,
which naturally failed, the chest at Iilia's Inn
now have a complete assassin garment available.

This set can only be wore if you're unarmed!

{b}New Weapon: Sand Cutter{/b}

With regards to AxlTrozz's Desert Temple, which
unfortunately was never finished of being mapped,
a new melee weapon, superior to Setzer, is available.

You'll need around level 85 to equip it, and this
is as far as our hints will go.

{b}Mana Guardians Ritual{/b}

The Mana Guardians performed a ritual, which lowered
their defense and luck permanently, but hit the Banshee
Bow in full, and it no longer crits.

However, having the curse changed by this ritual, its
base damage was increased, and it even make the archers
faster. Nobody knows for how long this will persist.

{b}Monster Hunters Update{/b}

Aidan and Ishi decided to give monster points for those
whom defeat Mana Guardians, Tormenta, and some of the
newer monsters ingame.

They hope that this way, adventurers all over
The Mana World prevent it falling in hands of the
invading army.

{b}Doomsday Event - The Invasion{/b}

The Mage Council of Tulimshar has monitored events
following the Great Quake and feel that something
ominous is spreading throughout The Mana World.
Monsters seem to of come out of every shadowy corner
and petty dieties has begun to make presence in dark
places. The council has made the call and you are
just one of the many people that will battle the
forces of evil, sending them back to the depths they
came from.

Be it warrior, archer or mage, you have answered the
call from the leaders of the world to fight back the
darkness that spread after the Great Quake. Even so,
the monsters strength is overwhelming, and not even
Tormenta is staying behind the eternal seals any longer.

And sensing adventurers and the mana world residents
weakness, someone decided it was a good idea to send an
invading army...

{b}We're replacing Hurnscald Tree{/b}

As of April 1st, we decided to replace Hurnscald Tree
with a giant Pink Mouboo statue.

We're also making the Pink Mouboo Temple the official
TMW religion and we'll burn down all the heretics!
