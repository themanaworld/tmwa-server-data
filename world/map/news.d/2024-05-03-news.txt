{b}TMW turned 20:{/b}
    The Mana World achieved a mindblasting feat!
We've been up and running for 20 years! Thanks to
everyone involved! It's really an amazing miracle.

Event had 3 parts.
    Rick Lime, a leprechaun, made an appearance.
Tricky and mischievous fun and chaos ensued. All
online players received their choice of Clover Top Hat,
Leprechaun Hat, Leprechaun Head or a Rainerang (expect
changes as it's the wrong weapon type, currently).

    The next day, pirates landed on Tonori Desert shores,
but it wasn't so simple. They were coming from the past,
where their fleet of 3 were anchored and the infamous pirate
Blanc, lead numerous seamen to battle. Players thwarted
Blanc's plan, scuttling ships and dispatching defenders!

    Meanwhile, ancient evil returned...
The Reaper crossed from the world of the dead! It attempted
to collect souls and bodies for its undead armies, taking
on leprechauns, pirates and players. The Reaper managed
to acquire fearsome powers! The players were steadfast.
Enraged, the Reaper sent them to the Abyss! It was a bad plan.
Burned by rough travel and beaten, The Reaper had to hide in
the shadows to recover.

The Mana World became safe again... for now.

{b}Server shakeups:{/b}
    Unfortunately it wasn't as simple as all that.
We faced server related fallouts, but despite life
giving us pressure we survived and continued with
our 20 year anniversary anyway.
    We reduced server VM specs to stay within
budget. It's still more than enough to keep the game
server fast. Thanks to Freeyorp for wrangling this.
    We also moved the wiki to an external resource. It's
now migrated to miraheze.org. Data migration was done
by thorbjorn.
    We would like to thank Jak1 for providing us with
powerful and nice hosting for CI builds and we thank
ko2fan for providing an even faster replacement.

If you notice any issues, please contact staff.

{b}Monsters:{/b}
    Since the last news record, TMW has had a sizable
number of new monsters originating from Evol or ML worlds.
Some are already on certain maps and others are not yet in
use, but present on the server.
    Now, there are bifs to gather ores and related items
and even more bifs/slimes to come. Frogs and tortugas
dwell near water, as well as crocs and many other things.
Ever fought a moubotaur? Mistook GM Tree for scenery?
(Apr 1 joke)
    Some new monsters were created especially for
thematic eventing and hopefully would prove to be
fun in the future. Ever fought rough Blanc and Emo or
met treacherous Rick Lime? Mont Blanc (ship) also got an
upgrade. Undead themed rotter and rot got added.

    GM spells for boss actions were created. This
allows for more interesting GM based events
    Asorm lasts longer. Changes to betsanc and
conc pots interactions (see Server)
    Dark shroom spawns are better but more costly

{b}Mana client:{/b}
    Mana client became active again! It supports
the current server protocol, at least to the point
it can connect to TMWA. It could use some polishing,
but it's exciting to see it back in business!

symbols added
    Max drops raised to 10

{b}Respawns change:{/b}
    Graveyard & Crypt entrance > Last menhir touched
    Crypt > Moor
    Northern Farmsteads > West adjacent map
    Mining camp (outside) > Mining camp (inside)
The only punishment for death is having to walk back,
which seems an improvement over none at all.
