{title:Dangerous Halloween}
{date:2019-10-07}

Hello Everyone!

Did you saw latest news? They're on the forum if you've missed!

{b}Higher Level Cap{/b}

After a bug which caused several issues (including data loss),
it left behind a "feature" which increased level cap to 135!

We asked the community about it, and most players said that
they're fine with a higher level cap, too.

{b}Tormenta the Boss{/b}

Tormenta came directly from the Abyss and is looking to run
loose in the surface after a long time. She also stole several
masks from previous Halloween events.

Killing her might not only make her drop a rare, but will also
give a decent amount of experience to anyone involved.
Note: Tormenta is at least as difficult as Luvia, so be prepared!

{b}Development Continues{/b}

As announced previously, we're hoping to have rEvolt released
soon. If everything goes well and as planned, we'll be releasing
after the Halloween ends; But this depends a bit on contributors.

{b}Minor corrections{/b}

We've also fixed Sailor's and Captain Hat's defense.
In case you had these decorative items, they now give
the defense they promised.
