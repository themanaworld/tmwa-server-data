{b}Iilia Rewards Change{/b}

This is just a whim update which removes Iilia quests rewards and replace them with
the assassin set (brawling only).

They were too OP and unbalanced and whatever, so we decided to make them unavailable
for the time begin.

We also have donated all the already existing Iilia gear to the pink mouboo church,
and replaced Constable Bob with the flying spaghetti monster.

Happy april fools day!
