{title:Fixes in Server Code}
{date:2013-09-28}

As you might have found out we had another restart yesterday.

Most of the changes for this restart are under the hood: this was
a Server Code release. Meaning the server's software was
changed but not the content. Hence user-facing changes are minimal,
but we'll outline below what's relevant.

The restart didn't work as smoothly as expected but we
are working hard on fixing all the issues which turned up.

Other bugs:{ul}
    {li}GM logs are now full-buffered (faster) instead of line-buffered.{/li}

A big behavioural change has been made to the Login Server
From now on the login name is case sensitive, this means
it matters whether you write a capital letter or not.
{gray}e.g. if you registered an account name Test, and always
logged in as test, this now no longer works. You have to
log in as Test.{/gray}
If you forgot how you originally registered your account,
and cannot log in, please checkout the forums

Please be aware that these code changes were necessary to move
the game forward. The server was formerly very hard to work on or
modify. This update goes a long way to fixing that and will allow the
developers to bring you new and exciting things in the future.

We are very sorry for the inconvenience. We have been working
as hard as we can to fix all the issues above.
