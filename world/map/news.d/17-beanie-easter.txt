{title:Easter Event and Miley's Hero}
{date:2013-03-21}

Today we have a content release.

As always there are a number of bugfixes,
but also two new quests.

One of them is an annual Easter event created by Pjotr Orial.
It lasts from March, 22th to April, 25th, and can be
repeated every year.
Watch out around Hurnscald for some hidden Easter Eggs!

The other quest is about the admiration of a little
girl in Hurnscald that sees you growing from an
inexperienced adventurer to an impressive hero.
Backstage, this was also about a great community effort.
veryape conceived of the idea for this quest and was able
to make it happen with the help of many people who were
assisting with the graphics, scripting, spell checking,
testing and giving valuable feedback.

Lastly, Brodomir's cave under Hurnscald has been made
easier for attracting fighters from all over the world.
