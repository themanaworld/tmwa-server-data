{title:Icon and Weapon Updates}
{date:2013-11-30}

With this update we ship new and better item icons.
Those have been done a long time ago and we
finally finished reviewing them all.

The behavior of items when you do not meet their
requirements has changed.

As a result, a new type of ranged weapon has
been introduced: the Sling Shot. You can get it
somewhere in Tulimshar. We are aware of some
small graphical glitches.

The behaviour of the happy-curse
for dark mages has been changed.
You might want to try it out. ]:-)
