This is an Interlude.

Is it time to take down Zax De'Kagen, or will he best the adventurers?
Get the Black Rose, explore the maze, seek the truth.

PS. You do not need a key to open the chests.

And then, there was silence.

Nobody heard from Jande or Zax De'Kagen for a while.

In the apparence of normality amidst the doomsday, questions are left unanswered.
Unable to return to Keshlam Maze, but in hold of the clues, one can only especulate.

What is the real meaning of things.
The calm can only mean one thing: The storm is soon to come.
