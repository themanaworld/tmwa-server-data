{b}We are now on Steam!{/b}

If you haven't done so already, wishlist us here: {link:https://store.steampowered.com/app/1570940}

Keep in mind that we'll likely transition The Mana World Classic to
Evolved before the Steam release, and you'll be able to use your
Steam account to play both on The Mana World and Moubootaur Legends.

Feedback is welcome!
