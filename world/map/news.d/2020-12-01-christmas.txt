{b}Christmas 2020{/b}

The Mana World Team wishes everyone a happy new Christmas!

By the way, Santa seemed very concerned with something.
Perhaps you could help him? Last I saw him, he was hanging in Nivalis.
If you hurry, maybe you can still catch him!

The Mana World: rEvolt release will be postponed at least until the event ends,
so enjoy your time and Christmas this year.

As they say: Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!
