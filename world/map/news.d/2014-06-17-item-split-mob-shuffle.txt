{title:Item Split & Mob Shuffle}
{date:2014-06-17}

Item Db was split into multiple files to make
it easier to maintain.

Added Mobs/Mob improvements:
{ul}
{li}Existing Mushrooms Art{/li}
{li}Moonshroom Added (Not In-game){/li}
{li}Mana-Bug Added (Not In-Game){/li}
{li}White Bell is now Agressive and has attacks{/li}
{/ul}

Mapflags Added to 004-3,-4,-5 to respawn local.

Rasin made accessiable for lowbies (hide n seek).

Banu pointing to forge to buy a knife.

Towel Cooldown accurately reflects the server cooldown.

monsters.xml is now relational with the Mob_db ID
(ex: maggot is now 1002 in both files.)
