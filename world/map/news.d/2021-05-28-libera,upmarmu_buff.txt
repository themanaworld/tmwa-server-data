{title:IRC Migration}
{date:2021-05-28}

{b}We are moving to Libera.Chat on IRC.{/b}

Game Chat, Discord Integration, et cetera are unaffected. All our bots have moved
as well. For those whom do not use IRC directly, no action is needed.

There weren't many votes on our community poll, but after witnessing with our own
eyes a channel being taken over without any sort of warning or whatsoever, we
have decided that Freenode no longer provides any sort of reliable operational
stability.

We are NOT taking this decision based on rumors - both true and fake - which are
circulating from both sides; We are taking this decision based on what we witnessed.

Therefore, we have settled to move all our infrastructure to Libera Chat, based
among other things, on the community will.

This is a strictly technical decision; Operational stability has always been a
priority for us, from backup to the choice of applications which are exposed to
the public, like our wiki and forums backbone. IRC is no exception to this rule.

We also have decided to DROP the bridge which was maintaining a link between
both networks for the reasons mentioned above. Therefore, users connecting to the
old network WON'T be able to receive any support whatsoever. Our other bots have
also withdrawn.
