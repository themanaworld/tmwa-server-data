Some of our new work includes:{/b}

Various NPC and other text corrections, Maze chests can now be reset (099-8), Candor
reward scaling corrected (for GM controlled difficulty), anchor stone improvements,
more mana battery effects were added (Xmas battle), two bug fixes to new GM teleport
system, new characters start game with a ragged shirt, mob spawning on a
parent mobs death and implemented on a few mobs (surprise!), many new mobs are now
live (seek them out), name values added to mods, since names don't show, more slime
sounds added.

New mobs and items:
{ul}
{li}Black armors (not yet craft-able){/li}
{li}Black Rose Hat (not yet craft-able){/li}
{li}Snowshroom{/li}
{li}Snowshroom Hat{/li}

{li}Head Slime... say WHAT!?{/li}
{li}Golden Skull{/li}

{/ul}

Don't forget about the Christmas quest. This is a good chance to get a free level up.
