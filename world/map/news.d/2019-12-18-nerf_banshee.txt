Hello Everyone!

This is a routine update, created to push the outcome of several
polls which were on Feedback section of the Forums.

{b}Nerf Banshee Bow{/b}

One of the most polemic threads, but not the most polemic one.

It ended up with the Banshee Bow damage being adjusted from 90 to 85.

The "average value" would be lower, but nobody likes nerfing, right?

{b}Increase Black Scorpion, Snakes and Spiders EXP{/b}

A lot of players wanted these monsters to give more experience,
but it was not enough to give what they wanted.

In the end, the experience of these three monsters was nearly doubled.

{b}Christmas Event changed{/b}

The less polemic of all, Christmas Event allows players to gain a
free level.
But this only works if your level was smaller than 99. Now, this
limit was raised to 135, to follow the Experience table.
