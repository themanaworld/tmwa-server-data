ManaPlus Support

We have decided to support ManaPlus as an
official client alongside Mana. In fact, since
there will likely be no more releases of the
Mana client that supports TMWA (this server),
there will inevitably be a time when ManaPlus
becomes the only supported client.

Mana 0.6.1 will continue to receive some
support until October 2013. We have no plans
to specifically break compatibility with Mana,
but new features may not be available.

For older clients (whether Mana or ManaPlus),
there will be different levels of attempted
support, depending on exactly how old it is:

* Less than 6 months old: will not crash or
    behave erratically.
* Less than 2 months old: will behave
    expectedly, but might not support all features.
* Last 2 releases: will do everything,
    correctly, on the main server.
* Last release, or even git, may be required
    on the test server.

Of course, if a particular client release is
buggy, we may not be able to support it at all.
