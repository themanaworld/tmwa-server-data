{b}Crypt Expansion{/b}

Although it was not the planned one, the crypt received a special expansion,
with a special theme from Doomsday Event.

It includes a new rare item for mages. The one who cries at crypt, shall give
you hints, but only if you dare, to at multiple boss glare.

(In other words, you must have a certain amount of Boss Points to unlock this
quest).

{b}Snake Experience Boost{/b}

Grass and Mountain Snake experience was doubled.
You can now level up in Snake Pit instead of Graveyard if you feel like it.

{b}Doomsday Event - Tormenta shows up{/b}

Seldomly, at 09:00 sieges, Tormenta will show up at her usual place.
No need to force yourself to wake up this late, as she'll not be there always.

{b}Doomsday Event - The Great War{/b}

Following the events from Act 2, the foreigner
invader assembles a bigger army and prepares to move
against Hurnscald.

Even the most magicless person should be able to sense
it arriving at Hurnscald Mines Entrance, ready to take
over The Mana World.
