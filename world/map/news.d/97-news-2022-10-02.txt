{b}New Weekly Event{/b}

Every Saturday, Blanc, the infamous pirate, Mirror Lake user and
CRC enemy will be sending hourly waves to TMW coasts.

Killing them may yield you a Dragon Shield. Maybe.
It is low chance, but an experiment on weekly events.

Some of these mobs may drop a corsair hat too?

{b}We Test in Production! (Phase II){/b}
Gentlemen, it is my pleasure to inform you that the
machine gun version of lightning is coming.

For about one week, mages will be able to use concentration
potions, speed focus, etc.
Do note that this may have unintended side effects as it was not
extensively tested. Please report any bugs, misbehavior, etc.

This is part of a major nerf described below:

{b}New Attack Speed Rules{/b}

Jesusalva's nerf machine gun is back to action, unfortunately.
Attack Speed bonuses are slightly less effective, details on forums:

{b}Some other changes and buffs{/b}

NPC dialog in Hurnscald Mines slightly tweaked to prepare for the
Skulls comeback in the next release.
Phylactery ASPD bonus went from +25% to +30%.
