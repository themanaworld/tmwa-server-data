{b}New Weekly Event{/b}

Every Saturday, Blanc, the infamous pirate, Mirror Lake user and
CRC enemy will be sending hourly waves to TMW coasts.

Killing them may yield you a Dragon Shield. Maybe.
It is low chance, but an experiment on weekly events.

Some of these mobs may drop a corsair hat too?


{b}Some other changes{/b}

NPC dialog in Hurnscald Mines slightly tweaked to prepare for the
Skulls comeback in the next release.
Phylactery ASPD bonus went from +25% to +30%.
Setzer attack speed was reduced in 10ms.
