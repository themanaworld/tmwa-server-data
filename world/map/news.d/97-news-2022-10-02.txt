{b}New Weekly Event{/b}

Every Saturday, Blanc, the infamous pirate, Mirror Lake user and
CRC enemy will be sending hourly waves to TMW coasts.

Killing them may yield you a Dragon Shield. Maybe.
It is low chance, but an experiment on weekly events.

Some of these mobs may drop a corsair hat too?

{b}New Attack Speed Rules{/b}

Jesusalva's nerf machine gun is back to action, unfortunately.
Magic is now affected by ASPD potions, Speed focus, and betsanc.
Attack Speed bonuses are less effective, see details on forums:

{b}Some other changes and buffs{/b}

NPC dialog in Hurnscald Mines slightly tweaked to prepare for the
Skulls comeback in the next release.
Phylactery ASPD bonus went from +25% to +30%.
