{title:Migration Mania and Bugfix Bonanza!}
{date:2025-11-09}

Good morning/afternoon/evening, as the case may be! Some lunatic let the new guy
write the news for this update, so allow me to introduce myself!

While I've known about The Mana World's existance for over a decade, I've only
recently started playing, and I'm still levelling my first character in the live
server. While I definitely lack the experience and expertise of the established
team, it's my hope that a new pair of eyes will find issues that others have
overlooked.

My first major task is migrating a number of existing quests to the quest log,
as you'll see below. Notably, the "Furquest" has been split into three entries,
which required a big refactor. It was a mammoth task, but it taught me a lot
about the game's scripting system and how to migrate other quests faster,
preferrably without major reworks. I've also identified a number of small issues
that have been addressed, and fixes that have been waiting for approval for
several months - as a result, this update doesn't add any new content, and only
makes small but significant changes that add to the overall quality of the game.

Here's hoping to some fun times ahead ;)
