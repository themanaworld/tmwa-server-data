This weekend we're temporarily doubling both the
experience rate and the drop rates for all monsters,
to give the chance to recover from the rollback
we had due to filesystem corruption.

There are also some bug fixes and new content:

The craftsmen of Tulimshar have finally moved to the
renovated Forge at the Northern Market, so the
Wizard's Inn is back to offering a calm stay for visitors.

In the woodland area the mysterious Evil Obelisk which
summons beings from the astral plane for the mundane
price of gold has drastically reduced its demands.

On the technical side, in case of network congestion,
you will no longer be kicked with an invalid packet error.
