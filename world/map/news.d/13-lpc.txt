This is a really exciting news entry!

Congratulations to our sister project Mana ({link:http://manasource.org})
on winning the Liberated Pixel Cup ({link:http://lpc.opengameart.org/content/code-judging-is-in}).

The project can be found at {link:http://www.sourceoftales.org/news.html}
and the irc channel at {link:irc://chat.freenode.net#sourceoftales}.

We will undoubtedly experience an influx of both
ordinary players and potential developers since we
were linked as a related project.

As a developer, it is my goal and expectation that
new players can figure things out on their own.
After all, I once did - though there wasn't as
much content back then (I feel old ...).

As for new contributors, they will necessarily need
to coordinary with us, the developers. We're always
in need of pixel artists, have great capacity for
quest writers, and currently have need for a bit of
web development and people crazy enough to touch
insides of the server code.

Be aware that people have different time zones and
busy schedules, so it may be a while before anyone
responds.
