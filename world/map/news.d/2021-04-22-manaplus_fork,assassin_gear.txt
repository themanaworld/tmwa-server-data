{b}ManaPlus Self-Fork Release{/b}

By popular demand, Jak1's official ManaPlus fork will now be provided by default
on our Downloads page. {link:https://themanaworld.org/downloads}

It has only a few improvements over the original ManaPlus.
You're not required to use it, but it is a good idea if you plan playing in...

{b}TMW Evolved Public Beta{/b}

The Mana World Development Team has a surprise for all of you.

We have decided to deprecate tmwAthena definitely. Instructions for building TMWA
servers were already removed from the wiki; Other tmwa sections will soon follow.

We have begun a side-project, dubbed TMW Evolved (working name "The Mess World").
It contains all TMW Classic data, as faithfully as possible, but in the new, modern
Evol2 servers. It has new bugs which needs to be found, reported and fixed.

There is no ETA for when the player data will be transfered from TMW Classic to
TMW Evolved and the current tmwa-based server shut down forever.

If you are using the self-fork release, select our test server, opt for using
"TMW Evolved updates", and then select "TMW Evolved" for world selection.

Official ManaPlus will require a workaround which will be on forums later.

{b}FAQ - How different is Evolved from Classic?{/b}

TMW Evolved {b}is{/b} TMW Classic, but in a more modern code. This does have some
implications, specially with magic. Spells will remain mostly the same, but the
way to obtain and use them have changed. It also allows stats to go up to 100 and
max level is 140 instead of 135. Not that we think anyone will reach, anyway.

We're also working on Magic Tier 3 code, which was flat out ruled as impractical
to be done on TMWA but is not so impossible on Evol2 code. At least that's what
was on the comments. It is not on the beta yet.

{b}FAQ - What about TMW rEvolt?{/b}

It is not immediately affected by these changes.

For now, please bear with us (and help us!) to make TMW Classic transition between
code bases the smoothest possible; And in due time we'll reveal the plan for TMW
rEvolt and Steam Release.

{b}Unofficial new quests{/b}

To celebrate the end of TMWA and because HoraK volunteered to write them, we have
added a new quest for the Assassin Gear. As Magic Tier 2 is finally coming to a
close, HoraK added a nice parting gift for it.

Both new quests will be different on TMW Evolved. For one, because Magic Tier 3.
For two, because magic in overall has changed.

That's it for today, HAVE FUN!
