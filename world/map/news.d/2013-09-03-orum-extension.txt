{title:Announcing Code update - Introducing Dark Magic}
{date:2013-09-03}

{gray}First, a technical announcement. During a future
restart, TMW will start requiring your username
to exactly match the case that you signed up with.

Previously, this was enforced erratically, and led
to people losing access to their accounts. If, after
the update, you are unsure of the case of the account
{red}and have already tried lowercase, UPPERCASE, and TitleCase,{/red}
please contact o11c or Frost.

Now, back to your regularly scheduled content news.{/gray}

Today we have introduced two new pieces.

First of all, the Orum extension is finished.
Orum and his master Waric have set a new base
to mess with Sagatha. Seek them out! They
hide somewhere in the Caves north of Sagatha's
Forests.

Someone has seen a few new spells being used.
No one is yet sure what exactly it is but a dark aura
has been percieved somewhere north of Hurnscald.
Find it! Maybe you can gain something useful!

Last but not least we have to announce bad news
for the project but good news for her:
Jenalya has, after finishing the Orum extension,
resigned from her position as Lead Content
Developer. We dedicate this news to her and
wish her only the very best for her future. She
contributed beyond words and her leaving
will leave a spot we will have to work hard to fill.
Wushin and tux9th took over as Lead Content Developers
and give their best to bring quality content to you,
like Jenalya did.
