{b}Happy New Year!{/b}

We want to thanks everyone whom stayed with us through 2021,
and cheer for another year with all!

To mark the start of a new phase, we're updating the login
wallpaper - the last update was in Oct 2009 by Spit, and this
one is by Reid.

For all the good years which have passed,
and for many more yet to come!

{b}Christmas 2021: Love Rejoined{/b}

The Mana World Team wishes everyone a happy new Christmas!

But there is a lonely skeleton,
you may remember him from past Halloweens.
His name is Gak. Gak gak gak.
Santa wants to do everything he can for him.

But not on the main server.
The Christmas Event will be happening on the Test Server instead.
You can read more details on the forum thread:

C'mon, you won't ruin Gak's Christmas because changing server
is too inconvenient or bothersome, will you?
This event will never happen again, so don't miss it.

Merry Christmas!
