Hello to everyone, regardless of gender or race! Yes, I am addressing
the shy Tritans among us!
Oh, your dog might also be interested in this.

So our last edition of the newspaper was on {red}March 1st{/red}.
It was about 45 days ago, so lets do a new post!

Here is the current progress report for the new server:

So while I would love to {red}bore everyone to death{/red}, talking about how
many placeholders we've added this last period - from adding a hideout
on Artis (where? It is a secret, of course!) to the fight against the Legion -
with several bugfixes, bringing Wyara back, adding minimaps to most
maps while still keeping Rossy's caves a secret, improving several minor
things, and adding some skills. Because seriously, we are The Mana World.
A Mana World without magic makes no sense, right?

But the thing is, I can't.
I know, many have missed Mona's dad's rescue operation. I know, many
missed the incredible desync which brought 4144 to release
ManaPlus 1.9.3.23. Throwing stuff in sewers, the Peter quest
redesign, and making sandwiches.
...but I don't have time for that. In case you just said "Neat, there
are progress bars on the picture", there are also due dates!

This means, as our (late) TMW birthday gift to the community,
{red}we decided on a deadline{/red}!

You know, the thing is - not even the developers can wait another year
for this game to be playable.
So we decided on a deadline, after lots of drama and bikeshedding on IRC,
as tradition demands, somewhere between {red}September and October 2019{/red}!

So, no more time to stop and chat, we have a game to finish if we want
to still be able to call it The Mana World.

Finally, do you know what makes The Mana World, The Mana World?
Here is a hint:
It is not the name. It is not the quests. It is not the graphics. And it is not
the player data either.
If you find out, please do not share. :>
