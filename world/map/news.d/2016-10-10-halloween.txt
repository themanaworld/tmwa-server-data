Halloween is here once again. An old friend has returned to us from his travels all over Gasaron.
The ancient skeleton Gak can be found in the woodlands of Argaes looking to feast on as much candy as he possibly
can before Halloween night. You will be able to collect candy that was stolen and scattered all over the world.
All kinds of creatures have been greedily hoarding this candy. It's your mission to claim it back and make sure Gak is satisfied.
In exchange, you will be rewarded on and after October 31st with some wonderful items that Gak has collected over
the past few years.{/li}
