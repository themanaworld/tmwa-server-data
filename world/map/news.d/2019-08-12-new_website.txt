{title:Shiny new website}

{b}Mobile-friendly website!{/b}
The homepage of The Mana World has been entirely redesigned to work on
mobile devices. It should now scale accordingly with the size of your
display so you shouldn't need to zoom anymore. Everything should be in
roughly the same places as before except for Account Recovery, which
has been moved under Support. Please report any issues you may encounter.

{b}TMW Hardcore{/b}
A new "world" has been added to the world selection list: TMW Hardcore.
This server is intended to provide a bigger challenge to players who have
become experts on the main server. It plays like normal except for these
important differences:
{ul}
{li}Death is permanent. There is no way to revive your character.{/li}
{li}Obtaining experience and leveling is much faster.{/li}
{li}The level cap is 127 and stats can go as high as 120.{/li}
{li}It is possible to kill other players in any map (except towns).{/li}
{li}Upon killing a player, you obtain all of their belongings.{/li}
{/ul}

Please note: The Hardcore server is NOT intended to be a replacement
for the main server; it is only an experiment and may close down at
any point in the future. Think of it more as a side-quest.
