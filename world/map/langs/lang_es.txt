"First, lay your hand on the person you wish to heal. You needn't touch the injury itself, though you have to touch the skin until you are a little more experienced. Then, medidate on the word '%s', which is the lay on hands magic."


"Great! You can take my turn with searching. You need to find all five of my friends.


"I'm playing hide and seek with my friends!


"Maybe I should go back to practicing '%s' until I can make potions properly." %%6

"She hates maggots.

(A mystical aura surrounds this stone. It seems to crave money.)


(A mystical aura surrounds this stone. You feel mysteriously attracted to it. Something tells you to touch it. What do you do?)


(As suddenly as the feeling started it stops. The strange attraction is away from one moment to the next and the obelisk feels like just an ordinary evil stone.)


(Leave)


(Logging out will also cancel any spell effects currently active in-game.).


(Suddenly a strange sensation flows through you. It feels like your body leaves your soul and becomes one with the stone.)


(You touch the mysterious obelisk. Somehow you feels peace and pain at the same time.)

... Tulimshar in Tonori ... I'm a Talpan.


... You hear a voice calling your name ... 


...Actually. I've heard rumors there was one on the hills northwest of here. They're just rumors, but feel free to go on an errand if you wish.


...Also, if you don't know what a Great Dragon is, then please, go visit a library. We the wizard council of Tulimshar have more important things to do.


...I see. That is surprising, to be able to take a form in this world without needing to deal with complex backstories.


...North of here is an exit. It is not connected to anywhere, just an infinite, never ending corridor, but if you ##Bcame##b from anywhere, it might as well work.


...Or used to, at least; I don't know why that's not true anymore... anyway...


...So why would they kidnap Cindy?? %%i

A few spells are not claimed by any particular school of magic. In practice, this means that anyone can cast them if they just have sufficient magical power. The most prominent example is the '%s' spell.


A few things are different here, you can read [@@https://wiki.themanaworld.org/index.php/Legacy:TMW_Evolved|on the wiki@@] some of the major differences.


A mana seed? I'm afraid that I can't help you with that.


A sunny and hot day,
Un soleado y caluroso día,

A wicked mushroom will appear to fight for you. Usually.


A-hoy matey!

But I can't keep doing that too much, and it is dangerous if you're alone, so make sure you have company. It is always more fun in groups.


But alas, thou need more magical power for that.


But be warned, monsters respawn on their own every five minutes.


But be warned: you won't be able to use advanced healing magic until you are more capable in your regular magic usage.


But in this side of the æther, where existence itself is challenged, time is hardly important.


But it might be too late.


But please don't tell Angela this. She is already a worrywart, knowing Balthasar is after her husband will only makes things worse.


But remember, the game isn't fun when you already know what to do. Use it well or you will lose interest in playing The Mana World! Please help by reporting anything that is unclear, outdated or that needs to be seen on our forums at %s.

I already finished my plans %s ago, otherwise I would not be bothering myself with you.


I always need components for my own healing spells. If you bring me ten gamboge leaves, ten alizarin leaves, ten mauve leaves and ten cobalt leaves, I can make ten lifestones; I will give you half of them.


I am sorry, but I don't think that I know anything that would help you.


I believe you have found the ruined Keshlam Swamps, didn't you?


I can recognize it's made of Zealite. That is... the same material from which our Soul Menhirs are made.


I can see horror in your eyes. I assume you fought whatever was there.


I can summon some creatures for you, and all of them drop %s at a decent rate.


I can trade you %d %ss for %d %s and %d GP.


I can't believe Gak refused to lend me Duck Tape! Then he went into the graveyard... Haven't seen him since.


I can't stay here and talk all day. I have a job to do.
No puedo quedarme aquí a charlar todo el día. Tengo cosas que hacer.

I changed my mind.
Cambié de opinión.

I did


I didn't


I do have another assignment for you, but this one will be tricky. I will need forty grass snake tongues. I believe that this may be just enough life force to return the silkworm back to its original shape.


I do not know, though I suggest to seek out a local alchemist, if there is any.


I figured out, maybe one of the sages could help. Would you mind asking them?


I have homework to do...


I have taught thee all I can teach for now.


I heard you aren't delivering any more living wood. Why not?


I hope you did not expected to kill me. Wait. You actually did?!


I hope you like this color.
Espero que le guste este color.

I just want to live my life in peace.
Tan solo quiero vivir mi vida en paz.

I know not what brought thee hither, but I kindly ask that thou leavest me alone in my sorrow.


I like you, so I'll tell you the bad word. But you can't tell anyone else about it! The bad word is %s.'


I lost my towel...


I need to finish studying for my test...


I said %s.


I see you killed all the %s needed.


I see. I should have sought someone more corageous, I guess. Please, stop wasting our time.


I think I would like to observe you for a little longer to see if you would make a good healer.


I think this island is a bit volcanic, as after the Great Quake, more land emerged.


I want to sleep...


I want to teach you my favorite. However, you are not powerful enough to use it yet; You will first have to absorb more magic from the mana seed.


I was just coming back from a long journey. I ran into a group of scorpions and started fighting them for experience.


I will make quick work of your wounds.


I will now teach you how to heal by laying on your hands. The technique is similar to the spell I taught you at the beginning, but this time you transfer your own health instead of drawing health from a lifestone.


I will only teach you magic of the school of Life, and that only if you prove yourself to be a good healer – that is, if you use your powers to help others.


I would like to change my species.


I would like to open Guild Storage.


I would like to perform money transactions.
Quisiera realizar transacciones de dinero.

I would like to store some items.
Quisiera almacenar algunos objetos.

I'd like to get a different style.
Me gustaría cambiar de estilo.

I'll be back later.


I'll be waiting here, come back and see after you've killed those mobs.


I'll think on it later.


I'm Chronos, lord of time, the immortal, the head editor of the Almanach, the... Alright, let's forget that.


I'm a little busy right now.
Ahorita ando algo ocupado.

I'm afraid I don't have anything now, please wait until my next travel, or complete the Tree of Knowledge quest for my amusement.


I'm afraid I don't have anything of value to reward you with, but some %s which my husband was saving for a quest or other. You can have them. Cindy is more important than a quest.


I'm afraid that this is all I can tell you for now.


I'm bored.


I'm busy with more important things!


I'm done for now, thanks!


I'm done.
He terminado.

I'm fine for now, thank you.
Por ahora estoy bien, gracias.

I'm hoping to animate them into the shape of one of those odd log heads.


I'm not even close to fainting yet.


I'm sorry, but I am not yet convinced that you are a good enough healer. Please continue in your endeavors.


I'm sorry, but I can't help you with that.


I'm still recovering myself, please wait %s before trying again.


I'm supposed to combine two potions to create a %s, but I can't seem to figure out which two to combine...


I'm trying to get work on my Alchemy homework, but I'm having some trouble.


I'm watching this mine to make sure the monsters don't harm the miners.


I've heard of Yetis %s little girls, and kidnapping them to eat immediately after.


I've taught you all I can for now. You should search for the Mana Seed, I've heard there was one north west of Hurnscald.

If a Yeti kidnapped your friend and you had the time to come here tell me this, they're likely already gone.


If an offensive spell requires an item, then after so many attacks, you may need to recast the whole invocation to stay attuned to the wand.


If she said Yetis doesn't do it, then they doesn't do it... In this world, at least.


If that was our future, how grim it is! Likely, the Soul Menhirs were destroyed on that... reality.


If the rumors are true and there really is a Mana Seed, then that would be wonderful news – perhaps we will have a few more healers soon!


If this is undesired, select the correct world, and if needed create a new char on it.


If you cannot handle it, maybe try asking staff for help...?


If you have unspent status points, you can level them up to 100. Focus skills work sightly different than on TMW Legacy. YOU NEED TO REFOCUS them!


If you kill every monster, this tree can warp you back.


If you know a native citizen of the world, all the better. Worlds tend to impose their own rules, after all.


If you meant to reset the drop rate to its default value: @droprate default


If you meant to reset the exp rate to its default value: @exprate default
Si busca restablecer el índice de experiencia a su valor predeterminado: @exprate default

If you must fight, call allies. You can call spiky mushrooms out of the ground with a mushroom spike and a root. Hold up the spike and call out to them: '%s'. Then press the root to the ground.


If you select a mode you cannot manage, please contact staff; I'll not clean the room, no matter whatever happens.


If you want to get in you will need to prove yourself first. Talk to Lieutenant Dausen, my superior, if you want to make a formal complaint.


If you're looking for Kytty, she went east, looking for Gwendolyn. You're welcome.


If you're using another client, settings and controls may be different.

It might be a good idea to drag the spell to the shortcut window, so you can target and attack using your keyboard instead of mouse.


It obviously did not work for them.


It seems that this is not the right key...


It seems to be in a time-lock, but we found a powerful entity which our wizards could not defeat. Try defeating it, and report back if you find out anything.


It seems you did not tell me the correct ingredients. Come back when you find the correct ones.


It seems you found %d out of 5 of my friends.


It seems you managed to amass quite a fortune!


It was a long time since the last time I visited a different world... But you're young. Maybe you can do it. However, keep it a secret.


It was impossible to conjure rain clouds on this map.


It worked!


It's very dangerous in here. We had a big earthquake here just recently, too... so be careful!

Now hold still, this won't hurt a bit...


Now leave. Spread chaos with the spells I have taught you!


Now that you are a student of mine, I will teach you some spells.


Now that you know the basics of nature magic, here is one of my favourites: '%s' will summon rain, whereever you are standing. It will consume a bottle of water, though.


Now, %s. The worlds are all different. The one you're going to may be similar but is far from a carbon copy of this one.

So I assume you thought in a way to seal me? Not that it matters anymore.


So be it, fellow warrior. Hear the incantation for the blade spell: '%s'


So my realm doesn't exist yet. Or perhaps it existed in the past, and is no longer the case. Whatever the case be, you're here, and you're welcome.


So please, do not bother me until you have some sort of trophy to show off. I'll repeat again the words you need to recite at the engraving:


So to remove that mental focus we will need a special potion.


So you think you're tough? A warrior must also be loyal and patient.
¿Así qué te crees muy rudo? Un guerrero también debe ser leal y paciente.

So, have you managed to transmute something?


So, lemme think. There was this world, "Moubootaur Lake" or something, don't recall how they call themselves.


So, you know about the Sages of Kaizei, right? We used to be twelve, but then Balthasar left after fighting with Santa, and now we're only eleven.


Some forest creatures sometimes overgrow their fur or hide. That makes them uncomfortable.


Some of it might jog your memory or at least help you catch your bearings.


Somehow, it does not feel *right* - Maybe you need to perform some sort of ritual before defeating the Grim Reaper?


Somehow, it does not feel *right* - We already defeated the Grim Reaper before anyway, didn't we?


Something else?
¿Algo más?

Sometimes you just need to run from battle.

Thank you for using our services. Please accept this little gift.


Thanks for all of your help.


Thanks for informing me. I'm sure Nikolai and the sages will do something about it, then.


Thanks for the %s of fun you gave me!


Thanks for this, I don't recall laughing so hard the past five years.


Thanks once again for helping with the monsters in the island.


Thanks!


Thanks, @@. We just wanted to be sure it was you.


Thanks, poppy.


Thanks.


That didn't work!


That invocation is '%s'.


That is obviously a lie, but will do for now.


That place have an eerie energy to it. And you know, not many things can scare an arch wizard.


That world's Celestia is %s but not necessarily on the same house, or with the exact same name, nor with the exact same clothes.


That would be great!
¡Eso sería genial!

Thats not what I said to do. Please don't skip ahead.


The "#world" chat tab is bridged to #themanaworld-dev on IRC and Discord, you can quickly get in touch with the whole community and report bugs using it.


The Beheader


The Egg cracks open and a living snake comes out of the egg.


The Ether Spirit of Air is finally compromised.


The Lost


The Mana World - Legacy


The Reaper drops a key - It might be valuable, so you keep it.


The Witch takes %s and %s and put them togheter calling %s.


The Wizard's thank thee as well.


The arch wizard seems to be busy.


The boss must also be defeated.


The culprits were never caught.


The deep basso voice continues.


The doctor examines you briefly.
El doctor te examina brevemente.

The doctor pulls out a syringe and fills it with a white liquid from a jar on his desk.


The dresser is empty.


The explanations in this tutorial are based on the Manaplus client.


The following names can be read on the pages: %s


The following word was written in blood: %s


The greatest heroes of all time


The invocation is `%s' followed by the last syllable of the name of the creature you want to shape the log into.


The last word on that page is '%s' and it's underlined twice with a comment next to it saying 'finally got it right.'


The message cannot be empty
El mensaje no puede estar vacío

The mines are closed from tourists due to the monster threat. You can visit the mining camp, but go no further than that.


The mines are to the right, top most cave. However, due the earthquake, other entrances have opened.


The mines are to the right, top most cave. Several other caves have opened, though. For your own safety... Stay away from these!


The next spell I have will make a normal tank top out of four pieces of cloth. The invocation is '%s', make sure to write this down.


The other half collides with the Earth Spirit,


The page after that is once again hastily written, with many crossed out words and sections and side remarks such as 'it almost worked' or 'it worked fine yesterday.'


The potion is called Grimace of Dementia. So the alchemist will know for sure.


The spell consumes a Small Mushroom and a Dark Crystal. Shove the Dark Crystal into the Small Mushroom and yell %s.


The spell fails!


The spell fulfills its inevitable purpose...


The spell is strong, so you only need to do this once. Be careful not to cut them. Some things they shed are useful. Often they will leave them to you as a thank-you.


The spell takes a mind of its own backfires!


The voice sounds slightly amused.


The witch glares at you in anger.


The witch's eyes flare up in anger as she notices you, and she turns away from you.


The wizard looks at you with despise.


The wizard looks at you, his eyes flashing, and laughs diabolically.


The wizard takes the crystal and the egg, mumbling something you don't understand. Suddenly, he throws the egg into the air and throws the crystal right through it midair.


The world around you slowly dissolves...


Then I fear that I shall not reveal the spell to you either.


Then I wish thee well in thy travels, wanderer!


Then chant the lesser healing spell, '%s', with whoever you wish to heal targeted.


Then come back later.


Then concentrate your anger upon the trees hereabouts, you will gain experience whilst leveling your sword skill on them.
Entonces desquítese con esos árboles. Ganará experiencia mientras nivela su habilidad con la espada.

Then please stop wasting my precious time.
Entonces por favor, deje de hacerme perder mi valioso tiempo.

Then say %s and let the mushroom's power take over. It only works on yourself, party or guild allies.


Then tell me the ingredients for the mouboo summoning spell and give them to me. Start with the first ingredient and then tell me the second one separately.


Then, out of a cave came a BLACK one! I had NEVER seen it before!


Then, she rises up on her tiptoes and kisses you on your forehead.


There are %d out of 5 found.


There is no answer.


There is no honor in fighting a weak opponent.
No hay honor en enfrentarse a un oponente débil.

There must be at least %d players to start.


There you are, right as rain! Now you take care, all right?


Thermal Napalm


These will do just fine.


They call me Sagatha.


They seem to be reminiscing Christmas 2021 event. Suddenly, they looks at you and shouts:


They're hiding somewhere on the island, you will have to explore to find them. They could be hiding anywhere."


Think a bit! Monsters respawn... Adventurers appear near the Soul Menhir...


Think on Mouboos and Cindy problems


Thinking back, Cindy was in a cage. Something seems off.


Thinking well, you will not be able to use it yet; you will first have to gain a greater understanding of magic overall.


This battle experience distribution is different, and death is final. Be careful!


This error is fatal, we stop execution.


This is a wand, there are many like it but this one is now yours.


This is an alchemy lab.


This is not a monster; I cannot use monsterinfo on it.


This is the server which will eventually take over TMW Legacy.


This is what Candor used to look like back in 2014.


This item is too cumbersome to use and could potentially break your valuable bow by accident. So you give up.

This place used to be part of Kaizei a few years back.


This place used to be part of Tonori a few years back.


This powder thou shalst need to cast the lightning spell. Throw it up into the air and shout '%s', and smite thine enemies with lightning.


This service is provided with no warranties on regards of side effects.


This skill can only be used on monsters!


This spell makes arrows out of a single wooden log. Its invocation is '%s'.


This switch is already active.


This was not in the plan, but was fun nonetheless. Worth the detour.


This will let your own life force flow into the person you are healing. If you are badly injured yourself, you will not be able to do this and may even injure yourself further.


This will only cure cuts and bruises, though, and it will take some time to take effect. It will be useless to mend broken bones or more severe injuries!


Thou hast collected %s Monster Points. For one thousand of them, I shall admit thee to the school of war magic.


Through a weird corridor. How do I leave?

To heal someone, first locate the injury. As a beginner, you have to touch the wound; with practice, it will be enough to think about it. Hold the lifestone in one hand, touching the wound with the other.


To heal yourself, it's enough to just cast by itself, without a target selected.


To ignore a player:


To interact with things in your environment or talk to NPCs you can either click on it or press N to focus and T to talk/activate.


To make a shirt, use the invocation '%s'. This will require five pieces of cloth.


To protect against others' magic, take a small mushroom from a shady place. Mushrooms draw things out of the earth. Rub your mushroom into pieces between your hands.

To use magic, first select the target, and use the skill to unleash the magical attack. The next attack will only come when you use the skill again; unfortunately, it is NOT automatic.

Unfortunately, a great landslide occured and it got completely engulfed by the sea.


Unfortunately, it almost vanished completely due to illegal dredging of the coast.


Unfortunately, that seems to require more magical power than you can use right now. If only the Mana Seed granted you more power...


Unfortunately, you can't make out what the transmutation is for or even whether it requires any materials...


Unlike lesser heal, it'll heal instantly, however it still cannot help if the person has a serious injury or has been inflicted with an ailment.
