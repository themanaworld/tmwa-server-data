Content Release January 2013
<p/>
This release brings a huge amount of small fixes
and changes, including fixes of several spelling
and map errors, which were reported by players.
Thanks for that!
<p/>
There are a few new things nevertheless:
New characters won't have to start their
adventure in underpants anymore,
and Doug in Dimond's Cove discovered that the
lamps in his room wear off after a while.

<p/>
A new peninsula has magically raised from the depths,
south of Hurnscald. A witch seems to be the source of
this strange phenomenon.
Why is she here, and what does she want?
<p/>
Further on the west, Lora Tay is willing to accept
new challenges to prove once more her skills.
<p/>

<p/>
Santa and his helpers have returned to Santa's residence
near Nivalis to prepare for Christmas.
Among the helpers, the preparations are moving smoothly
as they should.
The reinboos are excited this year since there will be a change
within their team!
But not everything is working out as planned.
<p/>
<font color="#0000ff">November 2012</font>
<p/>
Halloween has passed and several cities celebrated this event.
It seems the farmer Oscar just came back from a long journey
in one of these cities.
Probably he will have exciting things to tell.
<p/>
<font color="#0000ff">October 2012</font>
<p/>
The roadblock to the north east in Argaes was finally lifted
and parts of the road were reconstructed.
But there is still some work left until the connection to Port City is done.
In the Woods you can find a guy who lives alone, seeking seclusion.
Be careful not to disturb him. He is very vicious.
<p/>
The smith's apprentice Peter does good progress in mastering his
handcraft and learned some new techniques.
<p/>

<p/>
Agostine is well known for his magnificent winter clothes,
but he always dreamed of creating something truly exquisite,
something noble...
<p/>
An old veteran has set up camp in the caves below Hurnscald
after a life full of hardship and battle.
He may be old now, but he surely didn't lose his interest
in the art of combat!
<p/>

<p/>
Strange and ominous things are going on in Kaizei.
Many people around Nivalis have noticed White and Blue Slimes
around the area, which they have never seen before.
Where do those come from? Are they dangerous?
And why did they show up now?
Rumors say that they originate from the snowy mountains
north-west of Nivalis, where the famous Sage Nikolai
has his residence.
<p/>
Summer is coming near and it might be a good time
to visit the beach with your Towel and relax a while.
Oh, you don't have a Towel?
Well, in that case you might find someone on the beach
who can give you one!
<p/>

<p/>
Two announcements to make:
<p/>
It seems Tulimshar is finally recovering from the impacts
of the great earthquake.
Although the eastern half of the city is still closed,
it has become much more lively, with children playing between the houses,
farmers going back to their fields, reports of increased trade activity.
<p/>
Surely there are lots of tasks for a young adventurer!
<p/>
Near Hurnscald a bunny showed up that looks like an older version
of our well-known Easter Bunny.
But what is he doing there? And where is Easter Bunny?
<p/>
<font color="#0000ff">2012-02-12 (ooh, what a nice date)</font>
<p/>
Three pieces of news today.
<p/>
First, Mana 0.6.0 got released today. You can find it at
<a href="http://manasource.org">http://manasource.org</a>, or wait for your distribution.
<p/>
Second, we will be completely dropping support for the old
TMW 0.0.29.1 client soon - unless there is further reason
for delay, in April 2012.
<p/>
Finally, there will be a purge of accounts that have not been
used for over a year. This should help responsiveness
when logging in and choosing a character.

After all the activity in Nivalis due to the Christmas time,
the townsfolk would like things to be quiet again.
Unfortunately, some strange people have set up their camp
near the woods west of town.
They came from their village high up in the northern snow mountains.
What might have caused them to leave their hunting grounds
and come down to Nivalis?
<p/>
<font color="#0000ff">Christmas 2011</font>
<p/>
Christmas is coming near and Santa and his helpers are busy
preparing everything for the celebration in Santa's house near Nivalis.
But somehow... everything seems to go wrong.
Bad luck? Or rather - malicious interference?
It looks like someone could use your help.

Happy Halloween!
This year the governments of Argaes and Tonori have decided to sponsor
trick-or-treating across both continents.
Have fun and don't make yourself sick by pigging out!

Will Kill Monsters For Food?
<p/>
Recovery from the Great Earthquake is still
very slow throughout the world.  The vast
devastation still causes starvation and
a lack of work.  A side effect of the Great
Earthquake has been the increasing number of
aggressive monsters and dooms long thought
forgotten.
<p/>
To answer this problem Tulimshar
has issued a call to be spread far and wide:
"If you're hungry, if you need work, if you
are in search of adventure, come to Tulimshar.
Slaying monsters, liberating mines and
defeating the night horrors that terrify even
the most strong willed never paid so well!"
<p/>
Needless to say, many are answering this call.
You may very well be one of them.
<p/>
Olana, the Innkeeper's Daughter, Returns to
Hurnscald...But Where Are Her Daughters?
<p/>
Olana, who is staying in the West wing of the
Hurnscald Inn, has been away to Tulimshar with
her family since before the Earthquake.
"The Earthquake may of happened a couple years
ago, but everything is still messed up.
I would've returned immediately, but I didn't
want to put my family at risk until travel
became a little safer."
<p/>
When asked about her daughters, Olana smiled
"They love wandering the woods around here.
Other than the occasional bandit group, things
are usually much more peaceful around here than
in Tulimshar.  I just hope they don't wander
near these caves...I've heard many of them can
be quite dangerous."
<p/>

<p/>
A large shipment of gold coins was plundered
by pirates.  The shipment was to be sent to
Tulimshar as part of their effort to control
inflation.  "They seemed to just come out of
no where!  They took the shipment and my pet
squirrel Chompers!"  Captain Zierock reported
while in tears.
<p/>
It is believed the pirates divided the gold
then went separate ways to spend their spoils.
Ironically, these pirates were the target of
monsters, who plundered them not just for
their new found wealth, but also for their
crunchy bones and sea salty flesh.
<p/>
On that note, be on the lookout for Green Slimes,
which have grown hostile as they evolve to the
harsh Tonori desert, making them a threat to
travel and trade.  It is believed many of the
pirates attempted to cross the Snake Desert,
where they met the Green Slimes...and their
end.
<p/>
In other news, Andra, a friend of Hinnak, has
increased her agricultural knowledge and needs
help keeping the soil around the farm fertile.
Interested volunteers should speak with her
about how to help.
<p/>
Last, but certainly not least, Agostine has
returned to Nivalis.  While he enjoyed his
time in Tulimshar, mingling with other artisans,
he has missed his home in Kaizei.  "I made this
fabulous sweater, but nobody wanted to wear it
in this hot and smelly desert.  That is when I
decided enough was enough.  Sweat is just gross."

<p/>
Many battle hardened warriors took some time
during April and enjoyed helping the somewhat
forgetful Easter Bunny make his baskets. The
children surely must have enjoyed their sweets.
<p/>
The demi-god Golbenez has finally made good on
his promise to open a 'place of leisure' in
the form of an inn. Youngsters beware, since
the entrance to this inn is near the old
graveyard and could be dangerous.
<p/>
There have also been reports about a mysterious
stranger roaming the beaches near Tulimshar.
Be on the lookout if you are in the area.
<p/>

<p/>
Reports of bandit raids to the west of
Hurnscald has mobilized the town.  Those
injured by these bandits may have a long stay
ahead of them in Hurnscald's hospital.
<p/>
Shortly after Tulimshar loosened the tariff
on travel, skill trainers have come to Mana.
If one wants to improve themselves through
acquiring skills, be on the lookout for these
trainers.
<p/>
In other news, Taro is still missing, but
Diryn, an agent of Tulimshar, has established
a connection with the Kaizei area, making
travel to Nivalis possible again.  He still
assists the battle hardened travel distant
locations just outside of Hurnscald.  Getting
back can be done by finding Frozenbeard, a
pioneer who is mapping a trade route to get
to Nivalis by ship.
<p/>
Diryn's re-connection with Nivalis came none
too soon.  Golbenez, a demi-god who demanded
a half billion gold pieces for building some
sort of leisure place, scrapped the idea and
went for good old fashioned kidnapping to get
whatever he wanted from the world of Mana.
He kidnapped Santa Claus.  Fearful Santa may
 not gift the children of the world, wizards,
warriors and archers rallied to pay the
demi-god his demands.
<p/>
Shortly after Santa was freed, something more
sinister has come to Kaizei.  The yeti.
Sightings of this beast returns with stories
of them.  Though aggressive, their behavior
seems out of place.  They've never been known
as cave dwellers nor to kidnap people.
<p/>
Last, but definitely not least, Dimond's Cove
is observing "Burns' Supper" January 24-26th.
Shanon is hosting the event, which he promises
will be an excellent time for food, drink and
poems.

Recently, the ancient tradition of Hallowe'en
was celebrated across Argaes, Tonori and other
continents. Estimated tons of sweets were given
out to happy trick-or-treaters, and as with
most other years a lot of this vast total was
dropped on the night. Even a week and a half
after Hallowe'en, many kilograms of sweets
still litter our pleasant woodlands.
<p/>
After dozens of letters regarding the situation,
the Hurnscald Council has said that the best
solution would be to organise a team of
volunteers to work on collecting dropped sweets
and disposing of them - but it has yet to
organise any such thing.
<p/>
In the meantime, why not do your bit and collect
some sweets for yourself? If you don't mind them
being a bit old, you could be able to make the
biggest Hallowe'en haul in history.
<p/>
Additionally, we've been getting some reports of
a rather creepy skeleton hanging around the
woodland. He doesn't appear to be aggressive,
but he chatters unintelligibly at passers-by.
<p/>

<font color="#0000ff">Rollback</font>
2010-11-17
<p/>
Everything should now be running from a
complete save state (including storage, banks,
parties etc) that is even two days more recent
than what we were temporarilyrunning on before.
All credit to Platyna for speedy recovery and
even more recent backups. :)
<p/>
<font color="#0000ff">Server outage</font>
2010-11-16
<p/>
Things running on the four day old backups,
restricted to account save info and character
save info for now while we try to get other
databases working.
<p/>
This means no party data or storage data for
now, we'll try to recover that along with
everything else, as we should be able to get
a full saved state from within the past week.
<p/>
The current setup is more to have something
partially up, and so that people know what's
going on while we try to fix things; any
in-game progress made right now <font color="#ff0000">will not</font>
persist.
<p/>
<font color="#0000ff">Server outage</font>
2010-11-16
<p/>
Okay, apparently even that won't work right now.
Servers will remain <font color="#0000ff">offline</font> until we figure out
what we can do.
<p/>
<font color="#0000ff">Server outage</font>
2010-11-16
<p/>
We've just had a serious server crash, and the
databases seem to have been affected here. We're
currently running on some four-day old backups;
whether this will be a temporary measure or
whether newer ones are usable is yet to be
determined.
<p/>
Please note that the current state may only
be <font color="#0000ff">temporary</font>, and that if usable newer backups
are found within the next 24 hours, those will
be used instead, and any character progress
made may be lost. If no usable backups are
found during this time, the four-day rollback
will have to be permanent.
<p/>
More news updates will follow once we've
investigated further; we're doing what we can...
