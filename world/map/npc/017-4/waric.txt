// Current state: only dialog, magic teaching not finished
// Waric is intended to teach the player some dark magic spells
// in case the player is not a follower of Sagatha and can't become
// one anymore (killed the wounded mouboo or cut the druid tree).
// Waric would teach the spells based on the progress in the pentagram
// creation, but save which spells were taught in a different variable.
// Author: tux9th
// Editing a few things and creating the Quests for Dark Magic school and spells
// OrumQuest State 32 - had the talk about Dark Magic with Waric.
// OrumQuest State 33 - Completed the long talk with Waric
// OrumQuest State 34 - Aborted the oath of dark magic once
// OrumQuest State 35 - Aborted the oath of dark magic twice - cannot learn dark magic anymore.
// OrumQuest State 36 - Learned Dark Magic Skill.
// OrumQuest State 37 - Learned summon wicked mushroom.
// OrumQuest State 38 - Learned toxic dart.
// OrumQuest State 39 - Talked about summoning Snakes, get ingredients.
// OrumQuest State 40 - Given ingredients for Snake spell.
// OrumQuest State 41 - Learned Summon snake
// When extending these Quest Variable to 51 all of the other dark magic spells will be available. Keep this in mind.
