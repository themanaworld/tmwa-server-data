//#=========================
//#== NPC Baktar
//# Authors: Lien, PjotrOrial
//# Review: BigCrunch, Mistakes, Jenalya
//# This NPC has two stages:
//#
//# In the first stage you need to bring 7 different items, but only one of each kind.
//#
//# In the second stage he tells you what hard life he is living. He will be very aggressive telling you some stuff.
//# He will send you to kill Scroticular. That npc will be located in the labyrinth caves.
//# (its a mob actually, to be spawned only, if the players knows his name and his location)
//#
//# variables used:
//# @QUEST_Nivalis_state: NIBBLE0, NIBBLE1, NIBBLE2, NIBBLE3:
//# BYTE0 ( == NIBBLE0 | NIBBLE1)        stores in each bit information if that item was already brought.
//# bits:
//# bit 0        if you have met the npc already
//# bit 1        Desert Hat
//# bit 2        Desert Shirt
//# bit 3        Serf Hat
//# bit 4        tongue_Item
//# bit 5        eggs_Item
//# bit 6        skin_Item
//# bit 7        bugleg
//# NIBBLE2      store the progress after the item collecting stage:
//# =0 he will thank you for bringing all stuff.
//# =1 talking about his youth
//# =2 talking, you get the mission to hunt down Scroticular
//# =3 you get information where Scroticular can be found.
//# NIBBLE3     a bitmasking nibble for stage 2 again
//# bit 0  knows the name/location of the opponent
//# bit 1  killed the ugly opponent
