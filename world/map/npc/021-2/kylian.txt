// Kylian is a businessman from Argeas who wants to eventually open a shop in Tulimshar
// asks the player for several information about the city
// Quest uses Nibble 4 and 5 of QUEST_NorthTulimshar
// Author: Jenalya

// Nibble 4 is used as flags to indicate if the player knows certain places/persons
// Bit 0: player talked to Yanis in the government building
// Bit 1: player talked to Latoy on the market in North Tulimshar
// Bit 2: player talked to Weellos as the historic building
// Bit 3: player was in the casino rooms

// Nibble 5 is used to save the quest progress with Kylian
// state 1: player has the task to get the luggage from the harbor
// state 2: Adrian gave the luggage to the player
// state 3: player gave luggage to Kylian and Kylian asks who to talk to for the shop license
// after the player answered this, @KylianNTLicense is set.
// the player can only continue the quest when logging out and therefore setting that value to 0 again
// state 4: Kylian asks for a historical building to get some cultural knowledge
// state 5: Kylian asks where to get some typical food
// after the player answered this, @KylianNTSightSeeing is set.
// the player can only continue the quest when logging out and therefore setting that value to 0 again
// state 6: Kylian asks where to go to have some fun in the evening (casino)
// state 7: Kylian asks where to get exquisite clothing before going out in the evening
// after the player answered this, @KylianNTSightSeeing is set.
// the player can only continue the quest when logging out and therefore setting that value to 0 again
// state 8: Kylian was in the casino and gives a desert hat as reward
// state 9: To be continued here

// temporary variables used to check if the player logged out or left the building in the meanwhile
// this is to ensure some 'time in between' different actions of the quest
// @KylianNTLicense
// @KylianNTSightSeeing
// @KylianNTCasino
