//#     The first quest is to find Waric in the Caves with lots of torches.       #
//#     These torches must be set in the right color to have access to the next   #
//#     room, guarded by a magical barrier of other torches.                      #

//#     The second quest is an easy, but background-story telling quest.          #
//#     Just visit the cave again, find what is really in there.                  #
//#                                                                               #
