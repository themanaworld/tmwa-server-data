//#
//# gives the resist-poison skill, used global (!) variable: "$NPC_NURSE", split up in 4 bytes:
//# byte0 (bit 0-7) = healing_needed, byte1 (bit 8-15) = venum_needed, byte2 (bit 16-23) = stabilizer_needed
//# byte3 (bit 24-31) still unused
//# used player-variable: QUEST_Forestbow, nibble7
//# states:
//# 0    if skills are available, she tells you about her plans of doing the antidote,
//#     need black scorpion stingers and snake tongues
//# 1    waits for ingredients: black scorpion stingers and snake tongues
//# 2    waits for ingredients: acorns, apples, orange, healing potion, when these ingreds are there,
//#     she mixes the stuff (modify global variable!)
//# 3    you can start the minigame, 3 tries remaining
//# 4    you can start the minigame, 2 tries remaining
//# 5    you can start the minigame, 1 try   remaining
//# 6    not enough stuff remaining, jump to state 1
