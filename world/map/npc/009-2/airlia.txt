// Airlia, daughter of the cemetary caretaker

// Future extensions:
//   * Add banter and random replies for the unlimited subquests
//   * Airlia quest = 2 unlocks options with Fighters of the Undead NPCs (in Cemetery), such as the 'Kill Sir Truk' quest
//   * Airlia quest = 2 unlocks other options, perhaps with future Warrior Guild prospects (this is long term)
