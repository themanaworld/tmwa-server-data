// Blue Sage quest
// The mansion of the Sage is in disarray, because a magic experiment with the slimes went wrong,
// the white and blue slimes got out of control, ate most of the books in the library
// and most of the slimes escaped to the outside world
// Variable used: QUEST_BlueSage
// Author: Jenalya

// Subquests:

// Byte 0:
// Bit 0 - 4: Collect missing book pages
// some of the helpers are working on recreating the more valuable books
// they need the missing bookpages for that
// value gives the number of new pages given to the helpers (up to 31)
// bit 5: got Grimoire as reward for collecting the bookpages and bringing material to repair the books
// Bit 6: got reward for defeating the remaining slimes in the library
// Bit 7: unused

// Nibble 2 as flags: Bring material to repair the books and make new books
// Bit 0: Reed Bundles
// Bit 1: Silk Cocoons
// Bit 2: Yeti Claws
// Bit 3: Inks (Bottle of Water, Iron Powder, Wisp Powder, Spectre Powder, Poltergeist Powder)

// Nibble 3: Investigation of how the accident could have happened
// state 1: helper who is considered to have caused the accident asks the player to talk to the chief helper to find out if he's going to loose his job
// state 2: talked to chief and get the mission to investigate about what exactly happened
// there are two independent circumstances to gather information about, one is about how the helpers did their job (a) and another about a suspicious visitor shortly before the accident happened (b)
// this is saved as described here:
// (a) (b)
// 0    0 (state 2) started investigation
// 0    1 (state 3) talked to Janitor
// 0    2 (state 4) got more information about visitor
// 1    0 (state 5) talked to Peetu
// 1    1 (state 6) talked to Peetu and talked to Janitor
// 1    2 (state 7) talked to Peetu and got more information about visitor
// 2    0 (state 8) got more information about Peetu
// 2    1 (state 9) got more information about Peetu and talked to Janitor
// 2    2 (state 10) got more information about Peetu and got more information about visitor
// (a) first talk to the helper in the bedroom, who describes how careful he has been
// (a) and then to at least one of the helpers in the library, who supports that
// (a) it's possible to talk to more helpers, who will support too, but it suffices to talk to one
// (b) first talk to the janitor in the entrance room, who mentions the suspicious visitor
// (b) then talk to at least one of the helpers in the entrance room/library who give more information about the visitor
// (b) it's possible to talk to more helpers, who will give redundant information, but it suffices to talk to one
// so to have somed progress in (a) add three to the variable, and for progress in (b) add one
// state 11: reported to chief helper and got a reward
// state 12: told Peetu about the result and eventually got another small reward

// Byte 2: Hunt some remaining slimes between the bookshelves
// Bit 0: started the subquest
// Bit 1 - 7: each spawn point is unique and saved with a flag
