&lt;font color=&quot;#0000ff&quot;&gt;2022-04-26&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;We are now on Steam!&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
If you haven&#x27;t done so already, wishlist us here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1570940&quot;&gt;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1570940&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Keep in mind that we&#x27;ll likely transition The Mana World Legacy to
Evolved before the Steam release, and you&#x27;ll be able to use your
Steam account to play both on The Mana World and Moubootaur Legends.
&lt;br/&gt;
Feedback is welcome!
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Other changes&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The master of time has arrived with rares from all eternity...
...But his stock won&#x27;t last forever.
&lt;br/&gt;
Crypt now gives bonus boss points for doing it at lower levels.
&lt;br/&gt;
You can now summon more monsters on Evil Obelisk.
&lt;br/&gt;
Audsbel Snake Tongue request was nerfed.
&lt;br/&gt;
Tomatoes were added to the Fruit Shop (is tomato a fruit?)
&lt;br/&gt;
Magic Defense for several monsters was nerfed.
&lt;br/&gt;
A new Reaper is out and it has scythes! Be careful of evil GMs!
&lt;br/&gt;
Monster Point table was fixed. We have... plans.
&lt;br/&gt;
Graveyard is more dangerous, be careful!

&lt;font color=&quot;#0000ff&quot;&gt;2021-12-04&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Happy New Year!&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
We want to thanks everyone whom stayed with us through 2021,
and cheer for another year with all!
&lt;br/&gt;
To mark the start of a new phase, we&#x27;re updating the login
wallpaper - the last update was in Oct 2009 by Spit, and this
one is by Reid.
&lt;br/&gt;
For all the good years which have passed,
and for many more yet to come!

&lt;b&gt;Christmas 2021: Love Rejoined&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The Mana World Team wishes everyone a happy new Christmas!
&lt;br/&gt;
But there is a lonely skeleton,
you may remember him from past Halloweens.
His name is Gak. Gak gak gak.
Santa wants to do everything he can for him.
&lt;br/&gt;
But not on the main server.
The Christmas Event will be happening on the Test Server instead.
You can read more details on the forum thread:
&lt;a href=&quot;https://forums.themanaworld.org/viewtopic.php?p=162964&quot;&gt;https://forums.themanaworld.org/viewtopic.php?p=162964&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
C&#x27;mon, you won&#x27;t ruin Gak&#x27;s Christmas because changing server
is too inconvenient or bothersome, will you?
This event will never happen again, so don&#x27;t miss it.
&lt;br/&gt;
Merry Christmas!

<item><title>IRC Migration</title>
<description>
&lt;font color=&quot;#0000ff&quot;&gt;2021-05-28&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;We are moving to Libera.Chat on IRC.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Game Chat, Discord Integration, et cetera are unaffected. All our bots have moved
as well. For those whom do not use IRC directly, no action is needed.
&lt;br/&gt;
There weren&#x27;t many votes on our community poll, but after witnessing with our own
eyes a channel being taken over without any sort of warning or whatsoever, we
have decided that Freenode no longer provides any sort of reliable operational
stability.
&lt;br/&gt;
We are NOT taking this decision based on rumors - both true and fake - which are
circulating from both sides; We are taking this decision based on what we witnessed.
&lt;br/&gt;
Therefore, we have settled to move all our infrastructure to Libera Chat, based
among other things, on the community will.
&lt;br/&gt;
This is a strictly technical decision; Operational stability has always been a
priority for us, from backup to the choice of applications which are exposed to
the public, like our wiki and forums backbone. IRC is no exception to this rule.
&lt;br/&gt;
We also have decided to DROP the bridge which was maintaining a link between
both networks for the reasons mentioned above. Therefore, users connecting to the
old network WON&#x27;T be able to receive any support whatsoever. Our other bots have
also withdrawn.
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Improvements to #upmarmu&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
dangerDuck did some improvements to upmarmu (brawling skill).
&lt;br/&gt;
Check it out if you are a brawler!

&lt;font color=&quot;#0000ff&quot;&gt;2021-04-23&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;ManaPlus Self-Fork Release&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
By popular demand, Jak1&#x27;s official ManaPlus fork will now be provided by default
on our Downloads page. &lt;a href=&quot;https://themanaworld.org/downloads&quot;&gt;https://themanaworld.org/downloads&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
It has only a few improvements over the original ManaPlus.
You&#x27;re not required to use it, but it is a good idea if you plan playing in...
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;TMW Evolved Public Beta&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The Mana World Development Team has a surprise for all of you.
&lt;br/&gt;
We have decided to deprecate tmwAthena definitely. Instructions for building TMWA
servers were already removed from the wiki; Other tmwa sections will soon follow.
&lt;br/&gt;
We have begun a side-project, dubbed TMW Evolved (working name &quot;The Mess World&quot;).
It contains all TMW Legacy data, as faithfully as possible, but in the new, modern
Evol2 servers. It has new bugs which needs to be found, reported and fixed.
&lt;br/&gt;
There is no ETA for when the player data will be transfered from TMW Legacy to
TMW Evolved and the current tmwa-based server shut down forever.
&lt;br/&gt;
If you are using the self-fork release, select our test server, opt for using
&quot;TMW Evolved updates&quot;, and then select &quot;TMW Evolved&quot; for world selection.
&lt;br/&gt;
Official ManaPlus will require a workaround which will be on forums later.
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;FAQ - How different is Evolved from Legacy?&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
TMW Evolved &lt;b&gt;is&lt;/b&gt; TMW Legacy, but in a more modern code. This does have some
implications, specially with magic. Spells will remain mostly the same, but the
way to obtain and use them have changed. It also allows stats to go up to 100 and
max level is 140 instead of 135. Not that we think anyone will reach, anyway.
&lt;br/&gt;
We&#x27;re also working on Magic Tier 3 code, which was flat out ruled as impractical
to be done on TMWA but is not so impossible on Evol2 code. At least that&#x27;s what
was on the comments. It is not on the beta yet.
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;FAQ - What about TMW rEvolt?&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
It is not immediately affected by these changes.
&lt;br/&gt;
For now, please bear with us (and help us!) to make TMW Legacy transition between
code bases the smoothest possible; And in due time we&#x27;ll reveal the plan for TMW
rEvolt and Steam Release.
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Unofficial new quests&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
To celebrate the end of TMWA and because HoraK volunteered to write them, we have
added a new quest for the Assassin Gear. As Magic Tier 2 is finally coming to a
close, HoraK added a nice parting gift for it.
&lt;br/&gt;
Both new quests will be different on TMW Evolved. For one, because Magic Tier 3.
For two, because magic in overall has changed.
&lt;br/&gt;
That&#x27;s it for today, HAVE FUN!
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Iilia Rewards Change&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
This is just a whim update which removes Iilia quests rewards and replace them with
the assassin set (brawling only).
&lt;br/&gt;
They were too OP and unbalanced and whatever, so we decided to make them unavailable
for the time begin.
&lt;br/&gt;
We also have donated all the already existing Iilia gear to the pink mouboo church,
and replaced Constable Bob with the flying spaghetti monster.
&lt;br/&gt;
Happy april fools day!

&lt;b&gt;Beheader Quest&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
A strange man, with an even stranger weapon, has been spotted wandering The Mana
World as of late.
&lt;br/&gt;
We advise caution, so you do not end up losing your head by accident! (got the pun?)
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Valentine Day 2021&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
By popular demand of people trying to take advantage of the new beheader and trying
to behead myself, The Mana World will have a Valentine Day 2021 event.
&lt;br/&gt;
Quest opens on the saturday 13th 00:00 and closes on the monday 15th 23:59.
Look for the cutest NPC in Hurnscald to do the quest.
&lt;br/&gt;
The Mana World Team hopes you all have a great Valentine Day.

By the way, Santa seemed very concerned with something.
Perhaps you could help him? Last I saw him, he was hanging in Nivalis.
If you hurry, maybe you can still catch him!
&lt;br/&gt;
The Mana World: rEvolt release will be postponed at least until the event ends,
so enjoy your time and Christmas this year.
&lt;br/&gt;
As they say: Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!

&lt;br/&gt;
According to the Sage&#x27;s Council intel, Jande is currently being held in
&lt;b&gt;The Underworld&lt;/b&gt;. But there is no way to reach the underworld, nor to rescue
Jande from the Eternal Seals Prision...
&lt;br/&gt;
Or at least, that is what everyone thought.

&lt;li&gt;You can now obtain the MONOCLE in an epic quest! ...Not exactly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Golden Apple will now heal you instantly!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PVP Cap weight was fixed!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A golden (?) version of the PVP Cap was added.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PVP Coins were added, winning the tournament yields 1 coin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A character can only win up to 5 coins!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Doomsday Event&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;2020-06-11: Interlude (part 1)&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
This is an Interlude.
&lt;br/&gt;
Is it time to take down Zax De&#x27;Kagen, or will he best the adventurers?
Get the Black Rose, explore the maze, seek the truth.
&lt;br/&gt;
PS. You do not need a key to open the chests.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;2020-06-21: Interlude (part 2)&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
And then, there was silence.
&lt;br/&gt;
Nobody heard from Jande or Zax De&#x27;Kagen for a while.
&lt;br/&gt;
In the apparence of normality amidst the doomsday, questions are left unanswered.
Unable to return to Keshlam Maze, but in hold of the clues, one can only especulate.
&lt;br/&gt;
What is the real meaning of things.
The calm can only mean one thing: The storm is soon to come.

&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;b&gt;A Gift From Jande&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
A gift is available in Hurnscald Town, to encourage adventurers to keep fighting
for a future which includes them in it.
&lt;br/&gt;
It will be taken away in a later date.
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;New commands&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Two new commands were added:
&lt;br/&gt;
@bosspoints will show you how many boss points you have
&lt;br/&gt;
@deaths will report how many times you died D:
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Doomsday Event - The Great War&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Following the events from Act 2, the foreigner
invader assembles a bigger army and prepares to move
against Hurnscald.
&lt;br/&gt;
Even the most magicless person should be able to sense
it arriving at Hurnscald Mines Entrance, ready to take
over The Mana World.

&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Crypt Expansion&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Although it was not the planned one, the crypt received a special expansion,
with a special theme from Doomsday Event.
&lt;br/&gt;
It includes a new rare item for mages. The one who cries at crypt, shall give
you hints, but only if you dare, to at multiple boss glare.
&lt;br/&gt;
(In other words, you must have a certain amount of Boss Points to unlock this
quest).
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Snake Experience Boost&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Grass and Mountain Snake experience was doubled.
You can now level up in Snake Pit instead of Graveyard if you feel like it.
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Doomsday Event - Tormenta shows up&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Seldomly, at 09:00 sieges, Tormenta will show up at her usual place.
No need to force yourself to wake up this late, as she&#x27;ll not be there always.

&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Doomsday Event - The Great War&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Following the events from Act 2, the foreigner
invader assembles a bigger army and prepares to move
against Hurnscald.
&lt;br/&gt;
Even the most magicless person should be able to sense
it arriving at Hurnscald Mines Entrance, ready to take
over The Mana World.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Minor Balance Notes&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
We did several minor balance changes, like tweaking
Sand Cutter&#x27;s damage, increasing Mana Guardians XP,
and several other minor things which are actually
very important but even so, are still minor.
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Some patches you might have missed&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
On April 1st, we pushed a whole new equipment set to
Iilia, with brawlers in mind. We also added the quest
for a new weapon, the Sand Cutter.

&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Brawler Class: Assassin Set Released&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
After a huge attempt of assassination at Luvia,
which naturally failed, the chest at Iilia&#x27;s Inn
now have a complete assassin garment available.
&lt;br/&gt;
This set can only be wore if you&#x27;re unarmed!
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;New Weapon: Sand Cutter&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
With regards to AxlTrozz&#x27;s Desert Temple, which
unfortunately was never finished of being mapped,
a new melee weapon, superior to Setzer, is available.
&lt;br/&gt;
You&#x27;ll need around level 85 to equip it, and this
is as far as our hints will go.
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Mana Guardians Ritual&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The Mana Guardians performed a ritual, which lowered
their defense and luck permanently, but hit the Banshee
Bow in full, and it no longer crits.
&lt;br/&gt;
However, having the curse changed by this ritual, its
base damage was increased, and it even make the archers
faster. Nobody knows for how long this will persist.
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Monster Hunters Update&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Aidan and Ishi decided to give monster points for those
whom defeat Mana Guardians, Tormenta, and some of the
newer monsters ingame.
&lt;br/&gt;
They hope that this way, adventurers all over
The Mana World prevent it falling in hands of the
invading army.
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Doomsday Event - The Invasion&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The Mage Council of Tulimshar has monitored events
following the Great Quake and feel that something
ominous is spreading throughout The Mana World.
Monsters seem to of come out of every shadowy corner
and petty dieties has begun to make presence in dark
places. The council has made the call and you are
just one of the many people that will battle the
forces of evil, sending them back to the depths they
came from.
&lt;br/&gt;
Be it warrior, archer or mage, you have answered the
call from the leaders of the world to fight back the
darkness that spread after the Great Quake. Even so,
the monsters strength is overwhelming, and not even
Tormenta is staying behind the eternal seals any longer.
&lt;br/&gt;
And sensing adventurers and the mana world residents
weakness, someone decided it was a good idea to send an
invading army...

&lt;b&gt;We&#x27;re replacing Hurnscald Tree&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
As of April 1st, we decided to replace Hurnscald Tree
with a giant Pink Mouboo statue.
&lt;br/&gt;
We&#x27;re also making the Pink Mouboo Temple the official
TMW religion and we&#x27;ll burn down all the heretics!

&lt;br/&gt;
Hello Everyone!
&lt;br/&gt;
This update biggest objective is to give support to Valentine Day event.
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Valentine Day Event&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
This year, our valentine day event will NOT be hold on this server!
It will be host on a separate server specific for this purpose.
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Minor Corrections&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
A lot of minor corrections and bugfixes are included.
You should not be affected by them, as they are for very specific edge situations.
eg. keeping up arrow pressed, walking through Iilia&#x27;s Inn door multiple times
before quest is complete, and getting killed.
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Two new candies&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Part of rewards for Valentine&#x27;s. Happy Valentine for all!

&lt;font color=&quot;#0000ff&quot;&gt;2019-12-18&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Hello Everyone!
&lt;br/&gt;
This is a routine update, created to push the outcome of several
polls which were on Feedback section of the Forums.
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Nerf Banshee Bow&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
One of the most polemic threads, but not the most polemic one.
&lt;br/&gt;
It ended up with the Banshee Bow damage being adjusted from 90 to 85.
&lt;br/&gt;
The &quot;average value&quot; would be lower, but nobody likes nerfing, right?
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Increase Black Scorpion, Snakes and Spiders EXP&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
A lot of players wanted these monsters to give more experience,
but it was not enough to give what they wanted.
&lt;br/&gt;
In the end, the experience of these three monsters was nearly doubled.
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Christmas Event changed&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The less polemic of all, Christmas Event allows players to gain a
free level.
But this only works if your level was smaller than 99. Now, this
limit was raised to 135, to follow the Experience table.

<description>
&lt;font color=&quot;#0000ff&quot;&gt;2019-10-07&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Hello Everyone!
&lt;br/&gt;
Did you saw latest news? They&#x27;re on the forum if you&#x27;ve missed!
&lt;a href=&quot;https://forums.themanaworld.org/viewtopic.php?p=159297#p159297&quot;&gt;https://forums.themanaworld.org/viewtopic.php?p=159297#p159297&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Higher Level Cap&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
After a bug which caused several issues (including data loss),
it left behind a &quot;feature&quot; which increased level cap to 135!
&lt;br/&gt;
We asked the community about it, and most players said that
they&#x27;re fine with a higher level cap, too.
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Tormenta the Boss&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Tormenta came directly from the Abyss and is looking to run
loose in the surface after a long time. She also stole several
masks from previous Halloween events.
&lt;br/&gt;
Killing her might not only make her drop a rare, but will also
give a decent amount of experience to anyone involved.
Note: Tormenta is at least as difficult as Luvia, so be prepared!
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Development Continues&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
As announced previously, we&#x27;re hoping to have rEvolt released
soon. If everything goes well and as planned, we&#x27;ll be releasing
after the Halloween ends; But this depends a bit on contributors.
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Minor corrections&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
We&#x27;ve also fixed Sailor&#x27;s and Captain Hat&#x27;s defense.
In case you had these decorative items, they now give
the defense they promised.

<description>
&lt;font color=&quot;#0000ff&quot;&gt;2019-08-12&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Mobile-friendly website!&lt;/b&gt;
The homepage of The Mana World has been entirely redesigned to work on
mobile devices. It should now scale accordingly with the size of your
display so you shouldn&#x27;t need to zoom anymore. Everything should be in
roughly the same places as before except for Account Recovery, which
has been moved under Support. Please report any issues you may encounter.
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;TMW Hardcore&lt;/b&gt;
A new &quot;world&quot; has been added to the world selection list: TMW Hardcore.
This server is intended to provide a bigger challenge to players who have
become experts on the main server. It plays like normal except for these
important differences:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Death is permanent. There is no way to revive your character.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Obtaining experience and leveling is much faster.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The level cap is 127 and stats can go as high as 120.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is possible to kill other players in any map (except towns).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Upon killing a player, you obtain all of their belongings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Please note: The Hardcore server is NOT intended to be a replacement
for the main server; it is only an experiment and may close down at
any point in the future. Think of it more as a side-quest.

&lt;font color=&quot;#0000ff&quot;&gt;2019-05-01&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Hello Everyone!
&lt;br/&gt;
I&#x27;m making this announcement to tell you that our first
development milestone for the new server&#x27;s first release, 
titled The Mana World: rEvolt, is now 100% completed. 
The initial deadline was set at 31/05/19 but we managed to 
finish one month ahead of schedule!
&lt;br/&gt;
The milestone was called Artis Sewer and included all content 
relating to the underground maps under the city of Artis 
as well as some other bits of content that we wanted 
to be out at the same time. The next milestone, Artis Legion, 
currently sits at 75% completion with a deadline of 30/06/19, 
but given how quickly things have been moving I would say 
we&#x27;re well ahead of schedule for this one as well!
&lt;br/&gt;
The third and final milestone, Hurnscald, 
encompasses the biggest part of the release: 
the town of Hurnscald and the surrounding woodland 
region of Argaes. Its deadline represents an 
approximate deadline for the entire release 
and is currently set at 06/09/19.
&lt;br/&gt;
I want to say thank you to the people who have worked 
the most and the hardest in recent weeks to get us this far. 
Check out my forum post for my rant about that 
and some links to current development!

&lt;br/&gt;
Hello to everyone, regardless of gender or race! Yes, I am addressing
the shy Tritans among us!
Oh, your dog might also be interested in this.
&lt;br/&gt;
So our last edition of the newspaper was on &lt;font color=&quot;#ff0000&quot;&gt;March 1st&lt;/font&gt;.
It was about 45 days ago, so lets do a new post!
&lt;br/&gt;
Here is the current progress report for the new server:
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://forums.themanaworld.org/download/file.php?id=13446&quot;&gt;https://forums.themanaworld.org/download/file.php?id=13446&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
So while I would love to &lt;font color=&quot;#ff0000&quot;&gt;bore everyone to death&lt;/font&gt;, talking about how
many placeholders we&#x27;ve added this last period - from adding a hideout
on Artis (where? It is a secret, of course!) to the fight against the Legion -
with several bugfixes, bringing Wyara back, adding minimaps to most
maps while still keeping Rossy&#x27;s caves a secret, improving several minor
things, and adding some skills. Because seriously, we are The Mana World.
A Mana World without magic makes no sense, right?
&lt;br/&gt;
But the thing is, I can&#x27;t.
I know, many have missed Mona&#x27;s dad&#x27;s rescue operation. I know, many
missed the incredible desync which brought 4144 to release
ManaPlus 1.9.3.23. Throwing stuff in sewers, the Peter quest
redesign, and making sandwiches.
...but I don&#x27;t have time for that. In case you just said &quot;Neat, there
are progress bars on the picture&quot;, there are also due dates!
&lt;br/&gt;
This means, as our (late) TMW birthday gift to the community,
&lt;font color=&quot;#ff0000&quot;&gt;we decided on a deadline&lt;/font&gt;!
&lt;br/&gt;
You know, the thing is - not even the developers can wait another year
for this game to be playable.
So we decided on a deadline, after lots of drama and bikeshedding on IRC,
as tradition demands, somewhere between &lt;font color=&quot;#ff0000&quot;&gt;September and October 2019&lt;/font&gt;!
&lt;br/&gt;
So, no more time to stop and chat, we have a game to finish if we want
to still be able to call it The Mana World.
&lt;br/&gt;
Finally, do you know what makes The Mana World, The Mana World?
Here is a hint:
It is not the name. It is not the quests. It is not the graphics. And it is not
the player data either.
If you find out, please do not share. :&gt;

&lt;font color=&quot;#0000ff&quot;&gt;2015-02-03&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Starting with an errata: new tilesets for
Kaizei continent were announced for the last
update but actually they are the feature for
this one. Lots of typos in Xmas Inn were
corrected, and there are totally new descriptions
for skills that are featured on Skills window.
Parua has now some explanations about why Candor

<description>
&lt;font color=&quot;#0000ff&quot;&gt;2015-01-13&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The hugest change in this patch is the one in 
the tutorial, it&#x27;s faster and more intuitive, 
making new players more comfortable and able
to explore The Mana World faster. Also, now  
you can reach Nivalis by going through the 
Woodlands which makes a funny new way to travel.
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New tutorial starting at Candor Island.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ferry parting from Hurnscald easening access.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Now Ragged Shorts isn&#x27;t that useless at all.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nivalis counts with a new, neat tileset.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And Desert Mountains too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Minor typos and tile corrections.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reinboo now uses his own base sprite.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
The big patch this release is Heathin and Inya.
Heathin has had the price of terranite armor
reduced, but not the materials. Inya now sells
Simple Rings for 10 M. The Simple Ring is no 
longer a requirement to starting the Terranite 
Armor quest.

&lt;li&gt;Inya now sells Simple Rings.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Fix Key Bindings for Tutorial.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All scripts use builtin mapexit.&lt;/li&gt;

<item><title>Sounds like another bug hunt.</title>
<description>
&lt;font color=&quot;#0000ff&quot;&gt;2014-07-03&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
We had a major bug hunt and squashed a number 
of problems with the client-data and the client.
This should clear up and help latency and other
client bugs.

Most of the changes this time are internal, but the
Starting Area Redux is not. Among other things, it
make starting with magic not completely hopeless.
&lt;br/&gt;
In content:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Starting Area Redux &lt;a href=&quot;https://forums.themanaworld.org/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;amp;t=18299&quot;&gt;https://forums.themanaworld.org/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;amp;t=18299&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increasing the compatibility requirement of Manaplus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Botcheck &amp; Live Debug map separation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GM Island, A Place to hold GM Events so we don&#x27;t interfere with Hurnscald Questing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hurnscald Map Fixes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sling Shot color changed to wood as it&#x27;s now able to be dyed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;License File updates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
And the server code:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;removes support for gcc 4.6&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;significantly increase makefile speed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;adds support for libc++&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;removes old flex/bison generated files&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;generates new files for network protocol for much higher reliability (currently slow for rebuilds, waiting on evets for names to avoid conflicts while fixing)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;does random other cleanup&lt;/li&gt;

<description>
&lt;font color=&quot;#0000ff&quot;&gt;2014-04-16&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;#ff0000&quot;&gt;Attention Major Release:&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mana EOL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Server dependencies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Script clean-up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Magic clean-up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sprite 1.5 - Npcs As Sprites&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tilesets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Travel / Death / Warps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Client-data clean-up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tonori Improvement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Graveyard Improvement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Mana EOL:
    With this release, we are finally declaring the
Mana client obsolete. 90% of players are already
using ManaPlus.
&lt;br/&gt;
Server dependencies:
    The next release of the server code will require
a newer version of GCC: 4.7 instead of 4.6. This is
possible because Ubuntu is releasing a new LTS
so that servers can reasonably be expected to be
able to upgrade.
&lt;br/&gt;
    GCC 4.7 will be supported for much longer - a
year and a half or two years, until the next Debian
release.
&lt;br/&gt;
    The next release will also drop the dependency
on Flex and Bison ... which is more significant for
making the build system simpler and the surrounding
code cleaner than for actually being hard to acquire.
&lt;br/&gt;
Script:
    TMWA increased the level of debugging for
script parsing. The script language no longer
allows default fall throughs or &#x27;-&#x27; for a
menu option. It now reports Unused &amp; Duplicate
labels The menu fix was added to pave the
development of dynamic menus.
Simply running your script in the server reports
all errors in the scripts.
&lt;br/&gt;
Magic:
    Magic is now using a new config file format,
which will simplify build dependencies in future.
Anybody with local spells will need to manually
convert them. Although we have some helper
programs (tmwa-spell-convert and tmwa-sexpr),
For support of these ask on IRC
&lt;a href=&quot;irc://chat.freenode.net/themanaworld&quot;&gt;irc://chat.freenode.net/themanaworld&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Sprite 1.5/Npcs As Sprites:
    Sprite directory naming convention cleaned
up. If an NPC wasn&#x27;t animated it was made into
a player sprite with equipment. Thus anything
you see most the NPCs wearing will/can be
wearable player gear. We fixed and added more
gear than was currently in the main so a bunch
of new items have been added. Additional attack
frames add more weapon varieties and NPC
animations. As since the npcs are a sprite any
action the player sprite can do the NPC could.
It allows us to implement a mobile NPC. Most of
the sprites have dyes now. Including the player
sprite. This will make adding new races easier.
&lt;br/&gt;
    Making the NPCs player sprites makes it
easier to create them as well. If you can edit
an xml you can create a NPC. This will make it
quicker to start developing. Custom/Special
NPCs still exist, (see GY INN), They need to be
justified as to why they can&#x27;t be a Doll model.
&lt;br/&gt;
    Errors in the sprite should now be clearly
visible as we fixed the error image in the
client-data. It will draw an ugly error tile.
&lt;br/&gt;
Tilesets:
    Naming covention enforced to make dealing
with sets easier. Unused/old or broken sets
fixed or removed from repo except the plain
castle set. The Forrest was removed as it needs
to be properly cut to make it easier to map with.
    Tilesets will begin to be collasped into each
other. As they share a common/similiar theme
and/or style.
    We added animated water to some of the maps.
The tileset will work with all of the maps and
tilesets in game.
    We&#x27;ve begun to fill empty spaces in the tilesets
with a Open/Free marker. These will help us find
maps with errors.
&lt;br/&gt;
Travel / Death / Warps:
    Plain Hitchiker Towels are now part of the
starting gear. If you lost, sold or don&#x27;t have a
towel ask the nearest soul menhir for a replacement.
All towel colors are  available and each is set
to a location. Only the plain undyed towel can bind
to a soul menhir. The towels now have to wait to
recharge to be used again.
    Death is no longer travel system. Localized
graveyards keeps you close to the action. This
means shorter walks back from  the graveyard and
illia doesn&#x27;t reset your savepoint anymore.Using a
towel, a warp or walking is the only way back to a
city.
    Ship Travel does not cost anything anymore. The
ship now moves between the major docks. The ferry
schdules are available by the docks so you know where
it currently is. Once aboard wait for the ship to
come into the location you want and disembark.
    Dyrin&#x27;s sect of wizards &quot;The Travelers&quot; have
appeared in more locations about the world. speaking
with 2 members of his sect will allow you to move
between them, for a price. Members are located
throughout the world.
&lt;br/&gt;
Tonori Improvement:
    Added major art map additions to Tulimshar &amp;
surrounding areas. Castle, Noble, Beach Cliffs ,
&amp; etc.
    Starting area clean-up. Quest now uses bitmasking.
Sorfina gives you your first towel. Altered NPCs and
map to make room for Beach Cliffs.
    The children playing hide &amp; seek have been spread
out more to encourage exploring the wider areas
surrounding the city.
&lt;br/&gt;
Graveyard Improvement:
    Added major art map additions to the Graveyard &amp;
surrounding areas. More maps to grind Xp and to offer
a change of pace. These maps also have 3 new
mini-bosses for 60+ level characters. The Graveyard
reset has been removed.

&lt;br/&gt;
Today&#x27;s update includes bug fixes for the
Christmas Event (thanks to Chay).
Also the famous Hurnscald tree is back to its usual form.
&lt;br/&gt;
Southeast of Tulimshar, in the caves, you will find the
new map 043-4 which was designed to give you a
better possibility to train your character at the levels
around 60-80. Besides well-known monsters you
will find three new mobs there: Trolls, Undead
Trolls and Undead Witches. Thanks to Fother for
the great Troll graphics!
&lt;br/&gt;
Have fun with this update!

<description>
&lt;font color=&quot;#0000ff&quot;&gt;2013-12-25&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Happy Holidays!
&lt;br/&gt;
This year has been horrible for Santa. 
Nothing turned out as it was intended, in fact he didn&#x27;t 
even make it at the usual date.
&lt;br/&gt;
Gladly, Avalia, Santa&#x27;s utterly attractive apprentice stepped in
to make Christmas happen for all of the children and lonely
people around the mana world. Go to his workshop and see if 
you can help to make the magic of christmas happen, 
&lt;br/&gt;
... or make it a complete disaster, 
Orum has some helpers hidden in Nivalis who will guide your
way sabotaging christmas.
&lt;br/&gt;
This release is very late, so we are going to change reward 
and event time accordingly.
&lt;br/&gt;
The good thing is that you will now be able to visit 
Santa&#x27;s Inn throughout the year. 
Cassy breathed life into all those reinboos of last 
years Holidays.
Fothers Candied Slimes are going to cause the sweetest nightmares
you have ever had. Not sure if you are cruel enough to kill
a Pollett.

<item><title>Icon and Weapon Updates</title>
<description>
&lt;font color=&quot;#0000ff&quot;&gt;2013-11-30&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
With this update we ship new and better item icons.
Those have been done a long time ago and we
finally finished reviewing them all.
&lt;br/&gt;
The behavior of items when you do not meet their
requirements has changed.
&lt;br/&gt;
As a result, a new type of ranged weapon has
been introduced: the Sling Shot. You can get it
somewhere in Tulimshar. We are aware of some
small graphical glitches.
&lt;br/&gt;
The behaviour of the happy-curse
for dark mages has been changed.
You might want to try it out. ]:-)

<item><title>Fixes in Server Code</title>
<description>
&lt;font color=&quot;#0000ff&quot;&gt;2013-09-28&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
As you might have found out we had another restart yesterday.
&lt;br/&gt;
Most of the changes for this restart are under the hood: this was
a Server Code release. Meaning the server&#x27;s software was
changed but not the content. Hence user-facing changes are minimal,
but we&#x27;ll outline below what&#x27;s relevant.
&lt;br/&gt;
The restart didn&#x27;t work as smoothly as expected but we
are working hard on fixing all the issues which turned up.
&lt;br/&gt;
Currently known bugs that affect players:&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;None&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Other bugs:&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;GM logs are now full-buffered (faster) instead of line-buffered.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Admin documentation is wrong.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Fixed bugs:&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Problems with startup speed (possibly not new, fixed anyway).&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Guildbot wouldn&#x27;t start.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Some accounts and storages with corrupted items were deleted.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;You can turn every direction except right.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Inability to trade, except when naked.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Warp bug related to the new Orum/Waric quest.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Elemental bonus/malus not applied to magic.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Update stats from the new CDN.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Script bug with Kylian and checkweight.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Drop order was wrong.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Rossy caves now notice when you win fights.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Fix an incorrectly marked assertion, which could fail.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;#ff0000&quot;&gt;If you encounter any more bugs or problems please
report back immediately. Post on the forums
&lt;a href=&quot;http://forums.themanaworld.org/viewtopic.php?f=1&amp;amp;t=17729&quot;&gt;http://forums.themanaworld.org/viewtopic.php?f=1&amp;amp;t=17729&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
A big behavioural change has been made to the Login Server
From now on the login name is case sensitive, this means
it matters whether you write a capital letter or not.
&lt;font color=&quot;#919191&quot;&gt;e.g. if you registered an account name Test, and always
logged in as test, this now no longer works. You have to
log in as Test.&lt;/font&gt;
If you forgot how you originally registered your account,
and cannot log in, please checkout the forums
&lt;a href=&quot;http://forums.themanaworld.org/viewtopic.php?f=1&amp;amp;t=17737&quot;&gt;http://forums.themanaworld.org/viewtopic.php?f=1&amp;amp;t=17737&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;br/&gt;
Please be aware that these code changes were necessary to move
the game forward. The server was formerly very hard to work on or
modify. This update goes a long way to fixing that and will allow the
developers to bring you new and exciting things in the future.
&lt;br/&gt;
We are very sorry for the inconvenience. We have been working
as hard as we can to fix all the issues above.

<item><title>Astral Magic Extension</title>
<description>
&lt;font color=&quot;#0000ff&quot;&gt;2013-09-14&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
We have a small content release today.
A witch in Tulimshar has found some daunting spells
for mages who are experienced in Astral Magic.
Talk to her about that. Maybe she is willing to teach you.
&lt;br/&gt;
With this update, we have added some minor bugfixes for the
Waric script, Bluepar sprite and Wicked Mushroom sprite.

<item><title>Announcing Code update - Introducing Dark Magic</title>
<description>
&lt;font color=&quot;#0000ff&quot;&gt;2013-09-03&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;#919191&quot;&gt;First, a technical announcement. During a future
restart, TMW will start requiring your username
to exactly match the case that you signed up with.
&lt;br/&gt;
Previously, this was enforced erratically, and led
to people losing access to their accounts. If, after
the update, you are unsure of the case of the account
&lt;font color=&quot;#ff0000&quot;&gt;and have already tried lowercase, UPPERCASE, and TitleCase,&lt;/font&gt;
please contact o11c or Frost.
&lt;br/&gt;
Now, back to your regularly scheduled content news.&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Today we have introduced two new pieces.
&lt;br/&gt;
First of all, the Orum extension is finished.
Orum and his master Waric have set a new base
to mess with Sagatha. Seek them out! They
hide somewhere in the Caves north of Sagatha&#x27;s
Forests.
&lt;br/&gt;
Someone has seen a few new spells being used.
No one is yet sure what exactly it is but a dark aura
has been percieved somewhere north of Hurnscald.
Find it! Maybe you can gain something useful!
&lt;br/&gt;
Last but not least we have to announce bad news
for the project but good news for her:
Jenalya has, after finishing the Orum extension,
resigned from her position as Lead Content
Developer. We dedicate this news to her and
wish her only the very best for her future. She
contributed beyond words and her leaving
will leave a spot we will have to work hard to fill.
Wushin and tux9th took over as Lead Content Developers
and give their best to bring quality content to you,
like Jenalya did.

<item><title>Wushin overhauled caves, Ferry now goes to Nivalis</title>
<description>
&lt;font color=&quot;#0000ff&quot;&gt;2013-06-29&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
This release brings a few new additions to the game:
&lt;br/&gt;
Wushin overhauled the desert caves with an awesome
new cave tileset. Also the sewers below Tulimshar are
now accessible. Make sure to check them out!
&lt;br/&gt;
Malivox took the occasion to stop camping in the
desert and moved into a small house south of
Tulimshar.
&lt;br/&gt;
Frozenbeard has expanded his ferry service in
Nivalis. You can now go between Nivalis and
the other major docks both ways. Proper docks for
Nivalis are being worked on.
&lt;br/&gt;
With a ferry now serving Nivalis, Dyrin will send you
somehwere else in Kaizei instead, away from Nivalis.
&lt;br/&gt;
As usual there are also a lot of smaller fixes and
changes. Thanks to everyone who reported issues
and helped fix these things!

<item><title>Double Exp and Drop Weekend</title>
<description>
&lt;font color=&quot;#0000ff&quot;&gt;2013-06-07&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
This weekend we&#x27;re temporarily doubling both the
experience rate and the drop rates for all monsters,
to give the chance to recover from the rollback
we had due to filesystem corruption.
&lt;br/&gt;
There are also some bug fixes and new content:
&lt;br/&gt;
The craftsmen of Tulimshar have finally moved to the
renovated Forge at the Northern Market, so the
Wizard&#x27;s Inn is back to offering a calm stay for visitors.
&lt;br/&gt;
In the woodland area the mysterious Evil Obelisk which
summons beings from the astral plane for the mundane
price of gold has drastically reduced its demands.
&lt;br/&gt;
On the technical side, in case of network congestion,
you will no longer be kicked with an invalid packet error.

<item><title>Server Crash and Rollback</title>
<description>
&lt;font color=&quot;#0000ff&quot;&gt;2013-06-05&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
We had a server crash, and had to restore everything from offline backup.
&lt;br/&gt;
34 hours were lost, from about 17:30 (UTC) on 4 June to about 03:30 on 6 June. This affects the game, the forums, and the wiki.
&lt;br/&gt;
We&#x27;re going to set up hourly offsite backups of game, forum, and wiki data so that future outages are less painful.

<item><title>Small Bugfixes</title>
<description>
&lt;font color=&quot;#0000ff&quot;&gt;2013-04-28&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
We&#x27;re having a bugfix release today.
&lt;br/&gt;
The main areas that have been fixed are Brodomir&#x27;s PvP Cave
and Orum&#x27;s quest, both in the
caves below Hurnscald.
&lt;br/&gt;
Additionally, there were a lot of small fixes
on maps, spelling and grammar, and more.
&lt;br/&gt;
We&#x27;d like to thank all the people who reported issues and helped
testing!

<item><title>Easter Event and Miley&#x27;s Hero</title>
<description>
&lt;font color=&quot;#0000ff&quot;&gt;2013-03-21&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Today we have a content release.
&lt;br/&gt;
As always there are a number of bugfixes,
but also two new quests.
&lt;br/&gt;
One of them is an annual Easter event created by Pjotr Orial.
It lasts from March, 22th to April, 25th, and can be
repeated every year.
Watch out around Hurnscald for some hidden Easter Eggs!
&lt;br/&gt;
The other quest is about the admiration of a little
girl in Hurnscald that sees you growing from an
inexperienced adventurer to an impressive hero.
Backstage, this was also about a great community effort.
veryape conceived of the idea for this quest and was able
to make it happen with the help of many people who were
assisting with the graphics, scripting, spell checking,
testing and giving valuable feedback.
&lt;br/&gt;
Lastly, Brodomir&#x27;s cave under Hurnscald has been made
easier for attracting fighters from all over the world.
&lt;br/&gt;
